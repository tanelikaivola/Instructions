<p>With power applied, the tip temperature can be &gt; 300&deg;C. Failure to observe the following 
precautions may lead to injury to users or damage the equipment: 
</p>
<p>&bull; Do not touch any metallic parts of the hand-piece  
&bull; Do not use near flammable items  
&bull; Do not use unit for any function other than described in this manual  
&bull; Use only genuine MFR replacement parts  
&bull; Use in a well-ventilated area  
&bull; Do not use the equipment with wet hands  
&bull; Connect only to properly grounded outlets to prevent risk of electric shock. 
&bull; Always place hand-piece back into the work stand to prevent accidental 
</p>
<p>burning of oneself or surrounding objects. 
&bull; This appliance is not intended for use by persons (including children) with 
</p>
<p>reduced physical, sensory or mental capabilities, or lack of experience and 
knowledge, unless they have been given supervision or instruction concerning 
use of the appliance by a person responsible for their safety.  
</p>
<p>&bull; Children should be supervised to ensure that they do not play with the 
appliance.  
</p>
<p>Although the systems offer superior EOS (Electrical Overstress) protection, periodic 
checks of the instrument cord should be incorporated into standard operator 
maintenance procedures.

</p>
<p>Initial Setup &amp; Operation. 
</p>
<p>1. Connect hand-piece(s) to power unit output connector(s).
2. Insert your selected tip or cartridge into the hand-piece. Push the tip or
</p>
<p>cartridge all the way until it seats (See instructions supplied with each hand-
piece).
</p>
<p>3. Place hand-piece(s) into associated work stand(s).
4. Add distilled water to work stand sponge (sulfur free).
5. (MFR-2200) Select the desired channel using the selector switch.  Either Left,
</p>
<p>Right or Both (Selector switch is in the center position to run both channels
simultaneously)
</p>
<p>6. Plug the power cord into a grounded wall socket of the rated input line voltage.
7. To turn the unit on, push the AC power switch. The AC power LED should light
</p>
<p>up in green.
8. Unit must be grounded, otherwise it will not work, and the AC power LED will
</p>
<p>light in red.
9. Unit will not work in electrical network where an isolation transformer has been
</p>
<p>used.
Always use tip removal pad for changing tips.

Auto-Sleep and Auto Off Functions 
   
To prolong tip life, MFR systems with a soldering hand-piece (MFR-H1-SC2, MFR-H2-
ST2) include an &ldquo;Auto-Sleep Workstand&rdquo; (WS1).  When the hand-piece is placed into the 
workstand, the &ldquo;Auto-Sleep Workstand&rdquo; immediately reduces power to the hand-piece.   
All MFR systems have an &ldquo;Auto Off&rdquo; Function. The &ldquo;Auto Off&rdquo; Function will be engaged 
when the hand-piece has been idle in the sleep stand for a period of two hours. The 
channel LED indicator light will go from green to off.  The &ldquo;Auto Off&rdquo; Function can be 
reset by cycling the power switch.

<p>SmartHeat&reg; &amp; Calibration 
Each cartridge or tip is equipped with a self-regulating heater which &lsquo;senses&rsquo; its own 
temperature and tightly maintains its pre-set idle temperature for the life of the heater-tip; 
all controlled by OK International&rsquo;s proprietary SmartHeat&reg; Technology. The tip 
temperature is determined by the inherent metallurgical properties of the heater; no 
external adjustment or equipment is required. The power delivered to the tip 
automatically varies in direct response to the thermal load. This eliminates spikes and 
transients associated with electrically switched elements found in conventional soldering 
irons. Please feel free to contact your OK International representative with any 
questions. 
</p>
<p>Warranty 
OK International warrants the MFR against any defects in materials or workmanship for 
one (1) year from the date of purchase by the original owner.  This Warranty excludes 
normal maintenance and shall not apply to any opened, misused, abused, altered or 
damaged items. If the product should become defective within the warranty period, OK 
International will repair or replace it free of charge at its sole option. The repaired or 
replacement item will be shipped, freight prepaid, to the original purchaser. The warranty 
period will start from the date of purchase. If the date of purchase cannot be 
substantiated the date of manufacture will be used as the start of the warranty period. 
</p>
<p>The MFR-H2-ST2 hand-piece uses a coil assembly (MFR-CA3) which is a replaceable 
item.  OK International warrants the coil for 30-days regular use.
