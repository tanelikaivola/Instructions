1.6 Usage 
 
The Metcal Fume Extraction System is a portable, two-station filtration system 
for the removal of fumes, light dust or vapors at the work place. The filter set 
supplied with the filter unit depends on the model ordered. 
 
Model BVX-201 supplied with a pre-filter and a main filter. The main-filter is a 
combo-filter consisting of a HEPA filter with an efficiency of 99.95% at 0.3 
micron and an activated carbon filter. This model is designed for applications 
such as solder fumes from solder irons, solder pots, etc. 
 
Model BVX-203 supplied with a pre-filter and a deep-bed gas filter (activated 
carbon).  This model is designed for applications such as cleaning with 
solvents, conformal coating, etc.  
 
 
 

   WARNING!  
Consult your “safety department” when using the unit on flammable gases. This unit is 
not explosion safe and only used for the extraction of vapors, which have 
concentration levels well below the lower explosive limits.

2.2 Theory of Operation 
 
The efficient removal of hazardous fumes at your workplace is a two-step 
process: fume capture and filtration. The filter unit is supplied with a set of 
filters already installed.  
 
To capture the fumes, Metcal recommends use of optional exhaust arms and 
accessories (purchased separately). The exhaust arms need to be set up 
properly (instruction supplied with exhaust arm) and the nozzle positioned in a 
way to optimize the fume capture. 
 
Air extracted from your work area will be purified when passing through the 
filters inside the unit and then is returned into your work area.   
 
Contact your local Metcal representative if there are any questions regarding 
the proper selection of filters for your application.

4.0 Installation 
 
Remove Metcal Fume Extraction System from packing materials and place on 
the floor under workbench or near your work area where fume extraction is 
required. Make sure you have access to the unit for filter maintenance. 
 
Connect the unit power cord into the outlet on the side of the system. Plug the 
power cord into a grounded wall socket. 
 

  Warning!   
To provide protection against the risk of electrical shock, connect to properly 
grounded outlets only. 
 
Connect the unit to exhaust arms (optional) per installation instructions. 
To power up system, depress the power switch, located on the bottom right of 
the unit. (Red indicates “Power On” position) Operator can expect a delay of a 
few seconds before hearing fan running. This is due to a built-in motor “Soft-
start feature”. 
 
Position the exhaust arms to optimize the fume capture. 
 
Follow maintenance procedures below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



5.0 Maintenance and Cleaning  
 
5.1 Filter Unit - Maintenance and Safety 
 
The Metcal Fume Extraction System is designed with low maintenance in 
mind. The housing is ESD safe plastic. Here are a few tips to keep your 
system running in top shape: 
 
To clean, use a light wipe with a gentle cleaner to prevent build up of 
particulate and flux residue (be sure unit is turned off while cleaning). 
 

 Do not block the exhaust outlets; this will cause the operating temperature of 
the system to rise, potential damaging the unit, and drop in performance. 
 

 Do not defeat the filter interlock switch. Running the system without a filter 
will allow particulate and flux residue to adhere to the blower and decrease the life of 
the system and increase noise. 
 

 Do not lift system while operating 
 
 Be sure to handle filters with care. 

 
5.2 Filter Replacement Timing 
 
Model BVX-201 
When fumes are filtered inside the unit, the particulates captured will start 
clogging the filter over time. The coarse particles are collected in the pre-filter 
while fine particles will be collected in the HEPA filter.  The clogging will result 
in a reduction of the airflow, which may reduce the amount of fumes extracted 
from the work area.  This condition may not necessarily require filter 
replacement. One step is to move the optional extraction arms closer to 
application if possible. If the fumes are not extracted any longer to previous 
satisfaction level, filter replacement is required.  
 
Initially replace the pre-filter only.  If this step does not sufficiently improve the 
airflow, then replace the main filter (HEPA/Carbon).  
 

  Warning!  Do not attempt to clean filters. Attempted cleaning can 
damage filters and cause potential risk to health and equipment. 
 

 Notice:    Metcal recommends replacement of filters annually as a minimum. 
Use only original Metcal replacement filters. 
 



 
Model BVX-203 
This model features a deep-bed gas filter, which generally does not clog and 
reduce airflow as common with HEPA filters.  Replace both filters, pre-filter 
and carbon filter as soon as odors become noticeable. 
 

 Notice: Replace filters at least every 6 months, as most gas-phase filter media 
achieve saturation by adsorbing moisture from ambient air. Use only original Metcal 
replacement filters. 
  
 
 
 

Safety Switch

Filter Alignment 
Pins 5.3 Safety Interlock 

 
The safety switch is an interlock which 
turns off the fan when the main filter is 
removed and when the fan inlet opening 
is exposed.  The safety switch also 
prevents the system from operating 
without filters in which case the 
impurities would contaminate the 
internal unit. 
   
 

WARNING! Do not bypass safety interlock. Bypassing safety interlock could 
result in injury to persons.

5.4 Filter Replacement Procedure: 
 
1. Turn unit off. 
2. Disconnect the power cord. 
3. Unlatch the filter cover (see illustration on right).  
4. Remove filter cover. 
5. Replace the filters. (Pre-filter/main filter). Ensure to place main filter inside 

the alignment pins so that interlock switch is depressed. 
6. Replace filter cover and ensure proper fit on bottom housing. Hook both 

latches into filter cover and press down carefully.   
 Caution!  Do not use force. If latches do not close, check proper 

seating of filter cover on bottom housing. 
7. Reconnect power cord and turn system on. 
8. If unit does not operate, refer to troubleshooting section. 
 

  Notice: Always use new replacement filters!

5.5 Filter Disposal 
 
The gas filter collects some organic materials and care in disposal may be 
required. The filter may contain toxic materials and inhalation of dust particles 
or exposure to skin must be avoided. Please consult the MSDS Sheets for the 
material used at your facility and follow the prescribed handling instructions. 
 
 
6.0 Troubleshooting 

 
Problem Possibly Cause Check and Correction 
No air flow No Power Check On/Off Switch 

Check power outlet 
Check power cord    
Check for filter 
Check safety interlock switch 

Little air flow Air leak Check hose/arm for leaks  
Check hose/arm for proper installation 
Check hose/arm for partial clogging
