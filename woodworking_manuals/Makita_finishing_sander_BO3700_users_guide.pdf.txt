GENERAL SAFETY RULES USA002-2

(For All Tools)

WARNING:
Read and understand all instructions. Failure to follow all
instructions listed below, may result in electric shock, fire and/or
serious personal injury.

SAVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS
Work Area

1. Keep your work area clean and well lit.
Cluttered benches and dark areas invite acci-
dents.

2. Do not operate power tools in explosive
atmospheres, such as in the presence of
flammable liquids, gases, or dust. Power
tools create sparks which may ignite the dust
or fumes.

3. Keep bystanders, children, and visitors
away while operating a power tool. Distrac-
tions can cause you to lose control.

Electrical Safety

4. Double insulated tools are equipped with
a polarized plug (one blade is wider than
the other.) This plug will fit in a polarized
outlet only one way. If the plug does not fit
fully in the outlet, reverse the plug. If it
still does not fit, contact a qualified elec-
trician to install a polarized outlet. Do not
change the plug in any way. Double insula-

tion  eliminates the need for the three wire
grounded power cord and grounded power
supply system.

5. Avoid body contact with grounded sur-
faces such as pipes, radiators, ranges and
refrigerators. There is an increased risk of
electric shock if your body is grounded.

3

6. Do not expose power tools to rain or wet
conditions. Water entering a power tool will
increase the risk of electric shock.

7. Do not abuse the cord. Never use the cord
to carry the tools or pull the plug from an
outlet. Keep cord away from heat, oil,
sharp edges or moving parts. Replace
damaged cords immediately. Damaged
cords increase the risk of electric shock.

8. When operating a power tool outside, use
an outdoor extension cord marked “W-A”
or “W”. These cords are rated for outdoor
use and reduce the risk of electric shock.

Personal Safety

9. Stay alert, watch what you are doing and
use common sense when operating a
power tool. Do not use tool while tired or
under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or
medication. A moment of inattention while
operating power tools may result in serious
personal injury.

10. Dress properly. Do not wear loose cloth-
ing or jewelry. Contain long hair. Keep
your hair, clothing, and gloves away from
moving parts. Loose clothes, jewelry, or long
hair can be caught in moving parts.

11. Avoid accidental starting. Be sure switch
is off before plugging in. Carrying tools with
your finger on the switch or plugging in tools
that have the switch on invites accidents.

12. Remove adjusting keys or wrenches
before turning the tool on. A wrench or a
key that is left attached to a rotating part of
the tool may result in personal injury.

13. Do not overreach. Keep proper footing
and balance at all times. Proper footing and
balance enables better control of the tool in
unexpected situations.

14. Use safety equipment. Always wear eye
protection. Dust mask, non-skid safety
shoes, hard hat, or hearing protection must
be used for appropriate conditions. Ordinary
eye or sun glasses are NOT eye protection.

Tool Use and Care

15. Use clamps or other practical way to
secure and support the workpiece to a
stable platform. Holding the work by hand or
against your body is unstable and may lead
to loss of control.

16. Do not force tool. Use the correct tool for
your application. The correct tool will do the
job better and safer at the rate for which it is
designed.

17. Do not use tool if switch does not turn it
on or off. Any tool that cannot be controlled
with the switch is dangerous and must be
repaired.

18. Disconnect the plug from the power
source before making any adjustments,
changing accessories, or storing the tool.
Such preventive safety measures reduce the
risk of starting the tool accidentally.

19. Store idle tools out of reach of children
and other untrained persons. Tools are
dangerous in the hands of untrained users.

20. Maintain tools with care. Keep cutting
tools sharp and clean. Properly maintained
tools with sharp cutting edges are less likely
to bind and are easier to control.

21. Check for misalignment or binding of
moving parts, breakage of parts, and any
other condition that may affect the tools
operation. If damaged, have the tool ser-
viced before using. Many accidents are
caused by poorly maintained tools.

22. Use only accessories that are recom-
mended by the manufacturer for your
model. Accessories that may be suitable for
one tool, may become hazardous when used
on another tool.

SERVICE

23. Tool service must be performed only by
qualified repair personnel. Service or main-
tenance performed by unqualified personnel
could result in a risk of injury.



4

24. When servicing a tool, use only identical
replacement parts. Follow instructions in
the Maintenance section of this manual.

Use of unauthorized parts or failure to follow
Maintenance instructions may create a risk of
electric shock or injury.

USE PROPER EXTENSION CORD: Make sure your extension cord is in good condition.
When using an extension cord, be sure to use one heavy enough to carry the current your
product will draw. An undersized cord will cause a drop in line voltage resulting in loss of
power and overheating. Table 1 shows the correct size to use depending on cord length and
nameplate ampere rating. If in doubt, use the next heavier gage. The smaller the gage num-
ber, the heavier the cord.

SPECIFIC SAFETY RULES USB040-4

DO NOT let comfort or familiarity with product (gained from
repeated use) replace strict adherence to sander safety rules. If
you use this tool unsafely or incorrectly, you can suffer serious
personal injury.
1. Hold tool by insulated gripping surfaces

when performing an operation where the
cutting tool may contact hidden wiring or
its own cord. Contact with a “live” wire
will make exposed metal parts of the tool
“live” and shock the operator.

2. Always use safety glasses or goggles.
Ordinary eye or sun glasses are NOT
safety glasses.

3. Hold the tool firmly.

4. Do not leave the tool running. Operate the
tool only when hand-held.

5. This tool has not been waterproofed, so
do not use water on the workpiece sur-
face.

6. Ventilate your work area adequately when
you perform sanding operations.

7. Use of this tool to sand some products,
paints and wood could expose user to
dust containing hazardous substances.
Use appropriate respiratory protection.

WARNING
Some dust created by power sanding, sawing, grinding, drilling, and other
construction activities contains chemicals known to the State of California
to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm. Some examples
of these chemicals are:
• lead from lead-based paints, 
• crystalline silica from bricks and cement and other masonry products, and
• arsenic and chromium from chemically-treated lumber.

Your risk from these exposures varies, depending on how often you do this
type of work.  To reduce your exposure to these chemicals: work in a well
ventilated area, and work with approved safety equipment, such as those
dust masks that are specially designed to filter out microscopic particles.  

MAKITA LIMITED ONE YEAR WARRANTY
Warranty Policy

Every Makita tool is thoroughly inspected and tested before leaving the factory.  It is warranted to be free of 
defects from workmanship and materials for the period of ONE YEAR from the date of original purchase.  
Should any trouble develop during this one year period, return the COMPLETE tool, freight prepaid, to one of 
Makita’s Factory or Authorized Service Centers. If inspection shows the trouble is caused by defective 
workmanship or material, Makita will repair (or at our option, replace) without charge.

This Warranty does not apply where:

• repairs have been made or attempted by others:

• repairs are required because of normal wear and tear:

• the tool has been abused, misused or improperly maintained:

• alterations have been made to the tool.

IN NO EVENT SHALL MAKITA BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES FROM THE SALE OR USE OF THE PRODUCT.  THIS DISCLAIMER APPLIES BOTH DURING 
AND AFTER THE TERM OF THIS WARRANTY.

MAKITA DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
“MERCHANTABILITY” AND “FITNESS FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE,” AFTER THE ONE YEAR TERM OF THIS 
WARRANTY.

This Warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state.  
Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above 
limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.  Some states do not allow limitation on how long an implied 
warranty lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to you.
