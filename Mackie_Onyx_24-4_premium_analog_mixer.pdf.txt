class A/de class B (selon le cas) prescrites dans le réglement sur le brouillage 
radioélectrique édicté par les ministere des communications du Canada.

18. Exposure to extremely high noise levels may cause permanent hearing 
loss. Individuals vary considerably in susceptibility to noise-induced 
hearing loss, but nearly everyone will lose some hearing if exposed to 
sufficiently intense noise for a period of time. The U.S. Government’s 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has specified 
the permissible noise level exposures shown in the following chart.

 According to OSHA, any exposure in excess of these permissible limits 
could result in some hearing loss. To ensure against potentially danger-
ous exposure to high sound pressure levels, it is recommended that all 
persons exposed to equipment capable of producing high sound pres-
sure levels use hearing protectors while the equipment is in operation. 
Ear plugs or protectors in the ear canals or over the ears must be worn 
when operating the equipment in order to prevent permanent hearing 
loss if exposure is in excess of the limits set forth here.

u
s Introduction

Thank you for choosing a Mackie Onyx 4•Bus profes-
sional live mixing console. The Onyx 4•Bus mixers fea-
ture all-new analog circuitry and the latest technologies 
for live sound reinforcement in a durable, road-worthy 
package.

The Onyx 4•Bus mixing consoles replace the legend-
ary SR24•4 and SR32•4 VLZ PRO mixers. The new Onyx 
versions of these mixers maintain the same physical 
size, channel count and features of the originals, while 
adding a variety of new and improved features.

The Onyx 4•Bus consoles are equipped with our new 
premium precision-engineered, studio-grade Onyx mic 
preamps. Mackie is renowned for the high-quality mic 
preamps used in our mixers, and the Onyx mic pre’s are 
better than ever, with specifications rivaling expensive 
stand-alone boutique mic preamplifiers.

Each mono channel strip features an individual phan-
tom power switch, low-cut filter, mic input pad, pre-EQ 
channel insert, and an all new four-band EQ design with 
sweepable mids and EQ bypass switch.

All mono channels have six Aux sends, Pan, Mute, PFL 
Solo, 100 mm Fader, Group and Main Mix assign, and 
four signal-level indicators. In addition, balanced direct 
outputs are provided on DB-25 connectors (eight chan-
nels per connector) for multitrack recording.

The master section features two Stereo Returns, six 
Master Aux sends, four Group Masters, a 6x2 Matrix, a 
Phones/Monitor section, and a Talkback section with 
routing switches that allow you to communicate through 
the Aux Sends and the L/R mix. 

A new feature with the Onyx 4•Bus mixers is an analog 
stereo compressor/limiter that can be inserted at the out-
put of the L/R main mix, or the Group 1/2 or 3/4 outputs.

HOW TO USE THIS MANUAL
We know that many of you can’t wait to get your new 

mixing console hooked up, and you’re probably not going 
to read the manual first (sigh!). So the next section is a 
Quick-Start Guide to help you get the mixer set up fast 
so you can start using it right away. Right after that are 
the ever popular hook-up diagrams that show typical 
mixer setups for live sound, recording and mixdown.

Then, when you have time, read the Features Descrip-
tion section. This describes every knob, button, and 
connection point on the Onyx 4•Bus, roughly following 
the signal flow through the mixer.

Throughout this section you’ll find illustrations with 
each feature numbered. If you want to know more about 
a feature, simply locate it on the appropriate illustra-
tion, notice the number attached to it, and find that 
number in the nearby paragraphs.

This icon marks information that is 
critically important or unique to the 
Onyx 4•Bus. For your own good, read 
them and remember them. They will 
be on the final test.

This icon leads you to in-depth 
explanations of features and practi-
cal tips. While not mandatory, they 
usually have some valuable nugget of 
information.

A PLUG FOR THE CONNECTOR SECTION
Appendix B is a section on connectors: XLR connec-

tors, balanced connectors, unbalanced connectors, and 
special hybrid connectors.

Getting Started
READ THIS PAGE!!

Even if you’re one of those people 
who never read manuals, all we ask 
is that you read this page now before 
you begin using the Onyx 4•Bus. 
You’ll be glad you did!

Zero the Controls
1. Turn down the channel GAIN, AUX, and Fader con-

trols, and center the channel EQ and PAN controls.

2. Set all push button switches to their “out” positions.

3. In the Master section, turn all the rotary knobs 
“down,” the switches “out,” and the faders down.

4. Turn the POWER switch off.

Connections
If you already know how you want to connect the Onyx 

4•Bus mixing console, go ahead and connect the inputs 
and outputs the way you want them. If you just want to 
get sound through the mixer, follow these steps:

1. Plug a microphone or other signal source into chan-
nel 1’s MIC or LINE input [73/74]. 

2. Plug in the detachable linecord, connect it to an AC 
outlet, and turn on the Onyx 4•Bus’ POWER switch 
[90].

3. Connect cables from the Onyx 4•Bus’ MAIN OUTS 
[82] (XLR connectors or 1/4" TRS connectors on 
the rear panel) to your amplifier or active speakers.

4. Hook up speakers to the amp and turn it on. If the 
amplifier has level controls, set them however the 
manufacturer recommends (usually all the way up).

Set the Levels
To set the channel GAIN controls, it’s not even neces-

sary to hear what you’re doing at the outputs of the 
mixer. If you want to listen while you work, plug head-
phones into the PHONES jack [46] on the front panel, 
then set the PHONES knob [47] about one-quarter of 
the way up and the SOLO LEVEL [49] about halfway up.

The following steps must be performed one channel at 
a time.

1. Push in the channel’s PFL [18] solo switch.

2. Play something into the selected input. This could 
be an instrument, a singing or speaking voice, or 
a line input such as a CD player or tape recorder 

output. Be sure that the volume of the input source 
is the same as it would be during normal use. If it 
isn’t, you might have to readjust these levels during 
the middle of the set.

3. Adjust the channel’s GAIN [4] control so that the 
LEDs on the Left MAIN MIX meter stay around “0” 
and never go higher than “+10.”

4. If you’d like to apply some EQ, do so now and return 
to step 3. Remember to push in the EQ IN/OUT 
[11] switch or the EQ controls won’t do anything.

5. Disengage that channel’s PFL solo switch.

6. Repeat for each channel.

Instant Mixing
1. Leave the microphone plugged into channel 1 and 

connect a keyboard, guitar or other instrument to 
channel 2. Be sure to “Set the Levels” for channel 2 
as described above.

2. To get sound out of the speakers, push in the MAIN 
MIX assign switch [17] next to the faders on chan-
nels 1 and 2, turn up channel 1 and 2 faders [15] to 
the “U” mark and slowly turn up the MAIN MIX [72] 
fader to a comfortable listening level.

3. Sing and play. You’re a star! Adjust the faders for 
channels 1 and 2 to bring your voice and your 
instrument up and down to create your own mix.

Other Nuggets of Wisdom
•  For optimum sonic performance, the channel and 

MAIN MIX faders should be set near the “U” (unity 
gain) markings.

•  Always turn the MAIN MIX faders, GROUP faders, 
and MONITOR knob down before making connec-
tions to and from your Onyx 4•Bus.

•  When you shut down your equipment, turn off the 
amplifiers first. When powering up, turn on the 
amplifiers last.

•  Never listen to loud music for prolonged periods. 
Please see the Safety Instructions on page 2 for 
information on hearing protection.

•  Save the shipping box! You may need it someday, 
and you don’t want to have to pay for another one.

That’s it for the “Getting Started” section. Next comes 
the “Hookup” section that shows you some typical ways 
that you might use the Onyx 4•Bus in real applications. 
After that, take the grand tour of the mixer, with de-
scriptions of every knob, button, input, and output. We 
encourage you to take the time to read all of the feature 
descriptions, but at least you know it’s there if you have 
any questions.

s Hookup Diagrams

Onyx 24•4 Live Club Mix and Multitrack Recording

This hookup diagram demonstrates how you can 
make a live multitrack recording using the DIRECT 
OUTs. The DIRECT OUTs provide an analog balanced 
direct output for each channel, pre-EQ. The Matrix 
outputs are used to create a stereo recording for 
backup.

Aux Send 4 is used for stage monitors, and a graphic 
EQ is connected to the Aux 4 Insert jack, serving as 
a dedicated in-line EQ for the monitors. Aux Sends 
5 and 6 are used to drive a stereo IEM system. Aux 
Send 3 drives a stereo effects processor, whose stereo 
signal is returned via the Stereo Returns jacks.

Onyx 24•4 Stage Monitor Mix

This drawing shows the flexibility of the Onyx 4•Bus for creating different monitor 
mixes. Auxes 1-4 provide separate monitor mixes for four floor wedges. Auxes 5-6 
provide a stereo monitor mix for an in-ear monitor (IEM). The Aux Inserts can be 
used for in-line graphic EQ for each monitor send. A listen wedge is connected to 
the Monitor Out, allowing you to solo and listen to each monitor mix. The Talkback 
Mic lets you talk to the talent through the monitors (Aux Sends).

Onyx 24•4 House of Worship

In a House of Worship application, the Onyx 4•Bus provides plenty of Aux Sends 
for stage monitors, stereo in-ear monitoring, and assistive listening systems. The 
MONO output is used to provide front-fill for the first few rows not covered by the 
main PA speakers. A stereo graphic EQ is connected to the Main Inserts (the built-
in compressor/limiter provides system limiting for the Main Mix). Aux 6 is used 
as a subwoofer feed (a low-pass filter is built in to either the power amplifier or 
subwoofer). The Matrix A and B outputs provide additional custom mixes for the 
balcony and the nursery.

u
s Onyx 4•Bus Features

Mono Channel Strips
The Onyx 24•4 has 20 mono channel strips and two 

stereo channels, and the Onyx 32•4 has 28 mono channel 
strips and two stereo channels. Each mono channel has a 
mic and line input connector and an insert jack for con-
necting an external signal processor.

1. PAD Switch 

In most cases, you will leave the PAD switch out. How-
ever, you may have a microphone that produces a higher 
output signal than usual, which may require you to turn 
the GAIN control way down. If that is the case, push in 
the PAD switch to insert a 20 dB pad at the input to the 
mic preamp, to prevent overloading the microphone pre-
amp and provide better gain control.

2. Low-Cut Switch

The Low-Cut switch, often referred to as a high-pass 
filter, cuts bass frequencies below 100 Hz at a rate of 18 dB 
per octave.

We recommend that you use the Low-Cut switch on 
every microphone application except kick drum, bass 
guitar, bassy synth patches, or recordings of earth-
quakes. These aside, there isn’t much down there that 
you want to hear, and filtering it out makes the low stuff 
you do want much more crisp and tasty. Not only that, 
but the Low-Cut switch can help reduce the possibility 
of feedback in live situations and it helps to conserve 
amplifier power.

Another way to use the Low-Cut switch 
is in combination with the LOW EQ on 
vocals during live performances. Many 
times, bass shelving EQ can really ben-
efit voices. Trouble is, adding LOW EQ 
also boosts stage rumble, mic handling 

clunks, and breath pops. Low Cut removes all those prob-
lems so you can add LOW EQ without losing a woofer.

Here’s what the combination of LOW EQ and Low Cut 
looks like in terms of frequency curves.

3. 48V Phantom Power Switch 

Most professional condenser mi-
crophones require phantom power, 
which is a low-current DC voltage 
delivered to the microphone on 
pins 2 and 3 of the XLR microphone 
connector. Push in the 48V switch 
if your microphone needs phantom 
power. An LED lights just above the 
switch to indicate that phantom 
power is active on that channel.

Dynamic microphones, like 
Shure’s SM57 and SM58, do not 
require phantom power. However, 
phantom power will not harm most 
dynamic microphones should you 
accidentally plug one in while the 
phantom power is turned on. Be 
careful with older ribbon micro-
phones. Check the manual for your 
microphone to find out for sure 
whether or not phantom power can 
damage it.

Note: Be sure the MAIN MIX fader 
[72] is turned down when connect-
ing microphones to the MIC Inputs, 
especially when phantom power is 
turned on, to prevent pops from get-
ting through to the speakers.

4. GAIN Control

If you haven’t already, please read 
“Set the Levels” on page 5.

The GAIN control adjusts the input 
sensitivity of the mic and line inputs. 
This allows the signal from the out-
side world to be adjusted to optimal 
internal operating levels.

If the signal is plugged into the 
XLR jack, there is 0 dB of gain 
(unity gain) with the knob turned 
all the way down, ramping up to 60 
dB of gain fully up (–20 dB to +40 
dB with the PAD switch pushed in).

When connected to the 1/4" jack, there is 20 dB of 
attenuation all the way down, and 40 dB of gain fully up, 
with a “U” (unity gain) mark at about 10:00.20Hz 100Hz 1kHz 10kHz 20kHz

5. HIGH EQ

This control gives you 
up to 15 dB boost or cut at 
12 kHz, and is flat at the 
center detent. Use it to 
add sizzle to cymbals, and 
an overall sense of trans-
parency or edge to the 
keyboards, vocals, guitar, 
and bacon frying. Turn it 

down a little to reduce sibilance, or to hide tape hiss.

6. HIGH MID EQ

Short for “midrange,” 
this knob provides 15 dB 
of boost or cut centered 
at the frequency deter-
mined by its FREQ knob 
(see HIGH MID FREQ 
next). Midrange EQ is 
often thought of as the 
most dynamic because 

the frequencies that define any particular sound are 
almost always found in this range. The HIGH MID EQ 
range (400 Hz to 8 kHz) includes the female vocal range 
as well as the fundamentals and harmonics for many 
instruments.

7. HIGH MID FREQ

This knob ranges from 
400 Hz to 8 kHz and 
determines the center 
frequency for the HIGH 
MID EQ filter. This allows 
you to zero in on the 
precise narrow band of 
frequencies you want 
to have affected by the 
HIGH MID EQ.

8. LOW MID EQ

This is a second mid-
range EQ control that 
provides 15 dB of boost 
or cut centered at the 
frequency determined by 
its FREQ knob. It extends 
down to 100 Hz, which 
includes the male vocal 
range and the fundamen-

tals of some lower instruments (guitar, lower brass). 

9. LOW MID FREQ

This knob ranges from 
100 Hz to 2 kHz and 
determines the center 
frequency for the LOW 
MID EQ filter. This allows 
you to zero in on the 
precise narrow band of 
frequencies you want to 
have affected by the LOW 
MID EQ.

10. LOW EQ

This control gives you 
up to 15 dB of boost or cut 
at 80 Hz. The circuit is flat 
(no boost or cut) at the 
center detent position. 
This frequency represents 
the punch in bass drums, 
bass guitar, fat synth 
patches, and some really 
serious male singers.

Note: Used in conjunction with the Low Cut switch, 
you can boost the LOW EQ without injecting tons of 
infrasonic debris into the mix.

11. EQ IN/OUT Switch

This is a true hardware bypass of the Perkins EQ cir-
cuitry to insure that there is no coloration of the signal 
if the EQ is not needed. When this button is out, the EQ 
controls have no effect on the signal. You can use this 
switch to make an A/B comparison between the EQ’d 
signal and the signal without EQ.

We have completely redesigned the 
EQ circuits in the Onyx Series of 
mixers, based on the designs of Cal 
Perkins, an industry-leader in audio 
engineering for over three decades 
and long-time Mackie collaborator. 

This “neo-classic” design provides the sweet musicality 
of the British EQ sound, while still maintaining 15 dB of 
boost and cut with optimum Q and minimum phase shift 
(in other words, it gives you plenty of control and is 
pleasing to the ear!).

The 4-band equalization has LOW shelving at 80 Hz, 
LOW MID peaking, sweepable from 100 Hz to 2 kHz on 
the mono channels, HIGH MID peaking, sweepable from 
400 Hz to 8 kHz on the mono channels, and HIGH shelv-
ing at 12 kHz. “Shelving” means that the circuitry boosts 
or cuts all frequencies past the specified frequency. For 
example, rotating the LOW EQ knob 15 dB to the right 
boosts bass frequencies below 80 Hz and continuing on

u
s down to the lowest note you ever heard. “Peaking” means 

that the frequencies around the center frequency are 
less affected by the EQ the further away they are.

12. AUX Sends

These tap a portion of each channel’s signal (pre or 
post-fader) out to either an effects processor (post-fader) 
or for stage monitoring (pre-fader). The AUX Send lev-
els are controlled by the channel’s AUX 1-6 knobs, and 
by the AUX SEND MASTERS knobs [55].

These are more than just effects and monitor sends. 
They can be used to create stereo in-ear monitor mixes, 
generate separate mixes for recording, for another zone, 
or “mix-minuses” for broadcast.

13. PAN

PAN adjusts the amount of channel signal sent to the left 
versus the right outputs.

With the PAN knob hard left, the signal feeds the 
MAIN LEFT (and GROUP 1 and 3, depending on the 
setting of the GROUP ASSIGN switches). With the knob 
hard right, the signal feeds the MAIN RIGHT (and 
GROUP 2 and 4).

Constant Loudness 

The Onyx 4•Bus PAN control em-
ploys a design called “Constant Loud-
ness.” If you have a channel panned 
hard left (or right) and then pan to 
the center, the signal is attenuated 
3 dB to maintain the same apparent 

loudness. Otherwise, it would make the sound appear 
much louder when panned center.

14. MUTE

Press this switch to mute the individual channel. This 
disconnects the channel’s signal from all the Groups, 
the Main Mix, and Aux Send buses (pre* and post-
fader). You can still solo the channel (PFL) when the 
MUTE switch is pushed in.

* If the pre-fader Aux Send’s internal jumper is wired for pre-Mute 
[56], the MUTE switch will not affect the PRE Aux Send.

15. Channel Fader

The fader controls the channel’s 
level…from off to unity gain at the 
“U” marking, on up to 10 dB of ad-
ditional gain.

“U” Like Unity Gain

Mackie mixers 
have a “U” symbol 
on many of the 
level controls. 
This “U” stands 
for “unity gain,” 

meaning no change in signal level. 
Once you have adjusted the input 
signal to line-level, you can set the 
controls at “U” and your signals will 
travel through the mixer at opti-
mal levels. What’s more, many of 
the labels on our level controls are 
measured in decibels (dB), so you’ll 
know what you’re doing level-wise 
if you choose to change a control’s 
settings.

16. Signal Level LEDs

These LEDs indicate the channel’s 
signal level after the GAIN and 
EQ controls, but just prior to the 
channel’s fader. So even if the fader 
is turned down, you can see if a 
signal is present.

If you’ve followed the “Set the Lev-
els” procedure, the –20 and 0 LEDs 
should light frequently, the +10 
LED should light occasionally, and 
the OL (Overload) LED should not 
light at all. If the OL LED is blink-
ing frequently, the signal is probably 
distorted from overdriving the input. 
Either turn down the GAIN control 
or turn down the signal at its source.

17. GROUP and MAIN MIX ASSIGN Switches

Alongside each channel fader are three buttons 
referred to as channel assignment switches. Used in 
conjunction with the channel’s PAN knob, they are used 
to determine the destination of the channel’s signal.

With the PAN knob [13] at the center detent, the left 
and right sides receive equal signal levels (GROUPS 1-2, 
3-4, and MAIN MIX L-R). To feed only one side or the 
other, turn the PAN knob accordingly.

If you’re doing a mixdown to a 2-track, for example, 
simply engage the MAIN MIX switch on each channel 
that you want to hear, and they’ll be sent to the MAIN 
MIX bus. If you want to create a subgroup of certain 
channels, engage either the 1-2 or 3-4 switches instead 
of the MAIN MIX, and they’ll be sent to the appropriate 
Group faders. From there, the groups can be sent back 
to the MAIN MIX (using the MAIN MIX assign switches 
[70] next to the Group faders), allowing you to use the 
Group faders as a master control for those channels.

If you’re creating new tracks or bouncing existing ones, 
you’ll also use the GROUP ASSIGN switches, but not the 
MAIN MIX switch. Here, you don’t want the subgroups 
sent back into the MAIN MIX bus, but sent out, via the 
GROUP OUTS jacks [85], to your multitrack inputs. How-
ever, if you’re printing tracks via the DIRECT OUTS [76], 
the channel assignment switches don’t matter because 
the DIRECT OUTS come before the ASSIGN switches.

18. PFL SOLO Switch

This handy switch allows you to hear signals through 
your headphones or monitor outputs without having to 
route them to the MAIN or GROUP mixes. Folks use solo 
in live work to preview channels before they are let into 
the mix, or just to check out what a particular channel 
is up to anytime during a session. You can solo as many 
channels at a time as you like. It won’t affect what is 
coming out the MAIN OUT or GROUP OUT jacks.

The Onyx 4•Bus has two solo modes. PFL (Pre-Fader 
Listen) is the default solo mode, and the mode used for 
inputs, including soloing individual channels and the 
Stereo Returns. AFL (After-Fader Listen) is activated 
whenever an AFL switch is pressed on an output, includ-
ing an Aux Send, Matrix, or Group.

PFL solo mode always overrides any AFL solo mode.  
The Rude Solo LEDS [43] below the SOLO meters indi-
cate which solo mode is active.

Soloed channels are sent to the PHONES output and 
MONITOR outputs, and also to the MAIN MIX meters. 
PFL mode (Pre-Fader Listen) sends the channel’s signal 
after the GAIN and EQ controls, but before the channel 
fader, to the PFL solo bus (and appears on the LEFT 
meter). AFL mode (After-Fader Listen), sends the 
signal post-fader (and appears on the LEFT and RIGHT 
meters), making it ideal for mixdown soloing.

VERY IMPORTANT: Remember, PFL 
mode taps the channel signal before 
the fader. If you have a channel’s fad-
er set way below “U” (unity gain), PFL 
solo won’t know that and will send a 

unity gain signal to the MONITOR OUT and PHONES 
output. That may result in a startling level boost at 
these outputs when switching to PFL solo mode.

Stereo Channel Strips
The Onyx 4•Bus mixers each have 

two stereo channels. The stereo 
channels have a pair of 1/4" TRS 
line input connectors.

The stereo channels can be used 
as mono or stereo line-input chan-
nel strips, or to return the signal 
from an external effects processor 
connected to an Aux Send (if you 
want to apply EQ or more flex-
ible auxiliary routing to the signal 
than is available with the Stereo 
Returns). These versatile channel 
strips are nearly as full-featured as 
the mono channel strips.

19. GAIN Control

If you haven’t already, please 
read “Set the Levels” on page 5.

The GAIN control adjusts the 
input sensitivity of the stereo line 
inputs. This allows the signal from 
the outside world to be adjusted to 
optimal internal operating levels.

There is 20 dB of attenuation with 
the knob turned all the way down, 
ramping up to 20 dB of gain fully up, with a “U” (unity 
gain) mark at 12:00.

20. HIGH EQ

This control gives you up to 15 dB boost or cut above 
12 kHz, and it is also flat at the center detent. Use it to 
add sizzle to cymbals, and an overall sense of transpar-
ency or edge to the keyboards, vocals, guitar, and bacon 
frying. Turn it down a little to reduce sibilance, or to 
hide tape hiss.

21. HIGH MID EQ

Short for “midrange,” this knob provides 15 dB of 
boost or cut at 2.5 kHz. Midrange EQ is often thought of 
as the most dynamic because the frequencies that de-
fine any particular sound are almost always found in this

s range. The HIGH MID EQ frequen-

cies include the female vocal range 
as well as the fundamentals and 
harmonics for many instruments.

22. LOW MID EQ

This is a second midrange EQ 
control that provides 15 dB of boost 
or cut centered at 400 Hz. This 
includes the male vocal range and 
the fundamentals of some lower 
instruments (guitar, lower brass). 

23. LOW EQ

This control gives you up to 15 
dB of boost or cut below 80 Hz. The 
circuit is flat (no boost or cut) at 
the center detent position. This 
frequency represents the punch in 
bass drums, bass guitar, fat synth 
patches, and some really serious 
male singers.

24. EQ IN/OUT Switch

This is a true hardware bypass of

channel’s signal out to an effects 
processor or for stage monitoring. 
The AUX Send levels are controlled 
by the channel’s AUX 1-6 knobs, 
and by the AUX SEND MASTERS 
knobs [55].

26. PAN

PAN adjusts the amount of chan-
nel signal sent to the left versus 
the right outputs. On the stereo 
channels, the PAN knob works like 

the balance control on your home stereo (panning left 
turns down the right channel, and panning right turns 
down the left channel).

27. MUTE

Press this switch to mute the channel. This discon-
nects the channel’s signal from all the Groups, the Main 
Mix, and Aux Send buses (pre* and post-fader). You 
can still solo the channel in PFL mode when the MUTE 
switch is pushed in.

* If the pre-fader Aux Send’s internal jumper is wired for pre-Mute 

[56], the MUTE switch will not affect the PRE Aux Send.

28. Stereo Fader

The fader controls the stereo channel’s level, from 
off to unity gain at the “U” marking, on up to 10 dB of 
additional gain.

29. Signal Level LEDs

These LEDs indicate the sum of the channel’s left and 
right signal levels after the GAIN and EQ controls, but 
just prior to the channel’s fader. So even if the fader is 
turned down, you can see if a signal is present.

If you’ve followed the “Set the Levels” procedure, the 
–20 and 0 LEDs should light frequently, the +10 LED 
should light occasionally, and the OL (Overload) LED 
should not light at all. If the OL LED is blinking fre-
quently, the signal is probably distorted from overdriving 
the input. Either turn down the GAIN control or turn 
down the signal at its source.

30. GROUP and MAIN MIX ASSIGN Switches

Alongside each channel fader are three buttons 
referred to as channel assignment switches. Used in 
conjunction with the channel’s PAN knob, they are used 
to determine the destination of the channel’s signal.

The stereo channels are assignable to GROUPS 1-2, 
3-4, and the MAIN MIX. With the PAN knob [26] at the 
center detent, the left and right stereo signal is equally 
balanced. To feed only one side or the other, turn the 
PAN knob accordingly.

31. PFL Solo Switch

Like the PFL switch on the mono channels, this switch 
allows you to hear signals through your headphones or 
monitor outputs without having to route them to the 
MAIN or GROUP mixes. Since this is Pre-Fader Listen, 
you can listen to the stereo signal even when the chan-
nel fader is turned down. Unlike the mono channel PFL, 
the stereo channel PFL is a stereo signal (post-pan 
control), and therefore retains its left and right stereo 
image in the headphones and monitors, and appears on 
both LEFT and RIGHT meters.

The Rude Solo LEDS [43] below the meters indicate 
which solo mode is active.

Matrix, Compressor, and Metering Section

tantly, auto-gain compensation that provides the ap-
propriate amount of makeup gain based on the amount 
of compression taking place.

The following knobs and switches are used to control 
the compressor.

36. THRESHOLD

Determines the level at which the compressor begins 
to act on the incoming signal. It is calibrated in deci-
bels, ranging from –30 to +10 dB.

37. RATIO

Determines the change in output level as a function of 
the change in input level, once the threshold has been 
exceeded. The Ratio control ranges from OFF (1:1) to 
LIMIT (∞:1). Thus, if the ratio is 2:1, an increase in 
input level of 10 dB (assuming the input is above the 
threshold level) results in a 5 dB increase in output level.

When set to LIMIT, the compressor acts as a peak 
limiter. After the initial attack time, the output changes 
very little once the input crosses the threshold.

32. MATRIX A and B Input Controls

The Matrix A and B controls allow you to create sepa-
rate mixes, or a stereo mix, from Groups 1 through 4 and 
the Left and Right Mix outputs. Simply adjust the six 
matrix input controls to create the mix you want at the 
MATRIX A or B outputs.

33. MATRIX A and B MASTER Controls

Use these controls to adjust the overall signal level at 
the MATRIX A and B outputs.

34. AFL Solo Switch

The AFL switch allows you to hear the Matrix signal 
through your headphones or monitor outputs. This 
comes after the MATRIX MASTER, so you can hear the 
relative signal level of each Matrix output.

When you engage the AFL switch on both MATRIX A 
and B, the soloed signal appears in stereo in the head-
phones and monitor outputs. This is useful when you 
want to use both Matrix outputs to create a stereo mix.

Remember, PFL solo mode always overrides AFL solo 
mode. If you engage a PFL solo switch on a mono or 
stereo channel, the AFL solo is disconnected from the 
headphones and monitor outputs and replaced with the 
PFL signal. The Rude Solo LEDS below the SOLO meters 
indicate which solo mode is active.

35. COMPRESSOR/LIMITER

A compressor is used to reduce or limit transient 
peaks in a signal. As the input level to the compressor 
increases, the output level from the compressor increas-
es linearly until the threshold point is reached. After 
that point, the output level no longer increases linearly. 
Instead, it increases at a reduced rate determined by 
the ratio setting. In other words, the greater the ratio 
setting, the less the output level changes as a function 
of the input level.

A compressor is often used on an individual signal 
(voice) or group of signals (drums) to smooth out tran-
sients and allow signals to sit in the mix without harshly 
cutting through. A limiter, on the other hand, is often 
used between the mixer and the amplifier(s) to avoid 
power amplifier clipping or overdriving the speakers, 
known as system limiting.

The Onyx 4•Bus design team decided the compres-
sor/limiter functions could be carried out onboard using 
a new integrated analog stereo compressor/limiter chip 
designed by THAT Corporation. It provides threshold, 
ratio, fast/slow attack control and, perhaps most impor-

s 38. COMP ASSIGN

Use this switch to assign the compressor to either the 
MAIN MIX, GROUP 1-2, GROUP 3-4, or OFF (not assigned).

When the compressor is assigned to the MAIN MIX, it 
is inserted in the signal flow after the MAIN MIX fader, 
so it works as an external dynamics processor. Once the 
signal crosses the THRESHOLD, boosting the MAIN MIX 
fader results in little change in the output level (de-
pending on the RATIO setting).

When the compressor is assigned to one of the GROUP 
pairs, it is inserted in the signal flow before the GROUP 
faders. In this way, the compressor can act on a group of 
channels assigned to the subgroup (for example, drum 
microphones), and the overall level of the compressed 
group can be mixed into the main mix.

39. FAST ATTACK

The ATTACK setting determines how fast the com-
pressor reacts once the threshold has been exceeded. It 
also affects the release time, which determines how fast 
the compressor turns off once the signal falls below the 
threshold.

With the switch up, the attack and release times are 
calibrated to respond to the overall signal level without 
the audible “pumping” and “breathing” artifacts that are 
sometimes associated with compressors. In 
most cases, this is the setting you would use 
for live sound and recording applications.

There may be some situtations that 
require a faster acting attack and release. 
For example, mic’ing a snare drum produces 
some fast transient peaks that may get 
through the compressor before it can act 
on the signal. Pushing in the FAST ATTACK 
switch allows the compressor to react much 
faster on quick transient peaks and release 
the compression quickly between the peaks. 
You can experiment with both settings to 
determine which one works best in your 
application.

40. BYPASS COMP Switch

When the BYPASS COMP switch is pushed 
in, the signal bypasses the compressor, but 
still allows you to see the input signal level 
to the compressor and the amount of gain 
reduction applied to the signal on the me-
ters. This is useful when setting up the com-
pressor settings prior to actually engaging 
the compressor in a live sound application, 
and for making A/B comparisons between 
the compressed and uncompressed sound.

41. COMPRESSOR Meters

The INPUT meter indicates the signal level at the 
input of the compressor. Use this to help determine the 
setting of the THRESHOLD control. Once the input level 
crosses the threshold setting, the G.R. (Gain Reduction) 
meters begin to light (top to bottom), as they indicate 
how much gain reduction is being applied to the signal.

Note: If the COMP ASSIGN switch [38] is OFF, the 
COMPRESSOR meters will not indicate any signal.

42. LEFT/RIGHT Level Meters

The Onyx 4•Bus Left and Right Level meters are 
made up of two columns of twelve LEDs, with three 
colors to indicate different ranges of signal level, traffic 
light style. They range from –30 at the bottom, to 0 in 
the middle, to +20 (CLIP) at the top.

The 0 LED in the middle is labeled 0 dB = 0 dBu.

You may already be an expert at the 
world of “+4” (+4 dBu=1.23 V) and 
“–10” (–10 dBV=0.32 V) operating 
levels. What makes a mixer one or 
the other is the relative 0 dB VU (or 
0 VU) chosen for the meters. A “+4” 

mixer, with +4 dBu pouring out the back will actually 
read 0 VU on its meters. A “–10” mixer, with a –10 dBV

signal trickling out will read, you guessed it, 0 VU on its 
meters. So when is 0 VU actually 0 dBu? Right now!

Mackie mixers show things as they really are. When 0 
dBu (0.775 V) is at the outputs, it shows as 0 dB VU on 
the meters. What could be easier? By the way, the most 
wonderful thing about standards is that there are so 
many to choose from.

Thanks to the Onyx 4•Bus’ wide dynamic range, 
you can get a good mix with peaks flashing anywhere 
between –20 and +10 dB on the meters. Most amplifiers 
clip at about +10 dBu, and some recorders aren’t so 
forgiving either. For best real-world results, try to keep 
your peaks between “0” and “+10.”

Remember, audio meters are just tools to help assure 
you that your levels are “in the ballpark.” You don’t have 
to stare at them (unless you want to).

Note: The L/R meters indicate solo levels whenever 
an AFL or PFL solo switch is pushed in.

43. RUDE SOLO Lights

These LEDs flash on and off when a channel’s solo is 
active, as an additional reminder beyond the indicating 
LEDs next to each PFL or AFL button. The green LED 
indicates PFL solo mode, and the amber LED indicates 
AFL solo mode. If you work on a mixer that has a solo 
function with no indicator lights and you happen to 
forget you’re in solo mode, you can easily be tricked 
into thinking that something is wrong with your mixer. 
Hence, the RUDE SOLO lights. It’s especially handy at 
about 3 am when no sound is coming out of your moni-
tors but your multitrack is playing back like mad.

44. POWER Indicator

This LED indicates when power is applied to the Onyx 
mixer and the POWER switch is on.

45. LAMP Connector

This female BNC connector provides +12 volts DC for 
gooseneck lamps. See your Mackie dealer for gooseneck 
lamp recommendations (12 V lamp with BNC connector).

46. PHONES Jack

This is where you plug in your stereo headphones. It is 
a 1/4" TRS stereo jack and provides the same signal that 
is routed to the MONITOR outputs [78]. The volume is 
controlled with the PHONES knob [47].

WARNING: The headphone amp is designed to drive 
any standard headphones to a very loud level. We’re 
not kidding! It can cause permanent hearing damage. 
Even intermediate levels may be painfully loud with 
some headphones. BE CAREFUL! Always start with the 

PHONES level turned all the way down before connect-
ing headphones to the PHONES jack. Keep it down until 
you’ve put on the headphones. Then turn it up slowly. 
Why? Always remember: “Engineers who fry their 
ears, find themselves with short careers.”

Phones/Monitor, Solo, Mono, 
and Talkback Section
47. PHONES Level Control

This controls the signal level at the stereo headphone 
output [46].

48. MONITOR Level Control

This controls the signal level at the MONITOR output 
[78].

49. SOLO LEVEL Control

The SOLO LEVEL control is used to adjust the volume of 
the solo’ed signal as it is routed to the MONITOR [78] and 
PHONES [46] outputs. This control is independent of, and 
prior to, the MONITOR and PHONES level controls.

This controls the solo signal level for both PFL and 
AFL solo modes. You can use the SOLO LEVEL control 
to balance the solo levels with the main or tape levels at 
the MONITOR or PHONES out.

50. MONO Level Control

In addition to the Left and Right Main Mix outputs, 
the Onyx 4•Bus provides an independent monophonic 
output. The Left and Right Main Mix signals are 
summed and sent to the MONO OUT [84]. This controls 
the signal level at the MONO output.

51. MAIN TO MON Switch

This switch routes the stereo L/R Main Mix signal 
(post-fader) to both the Monitor and Phones outputs 
when there are no solo switches engaged. The L/R Main 
Mix signal is overridden in the Monitor and Phones 
outputs by any PFL or AFL solo.

Note: If a PFL solo switch is engaged, it overrides the 
AFL solo mode, including MAIN TO MON/PHONES.

s TALKBACK Section

The talkback feature allows the engineer to com-
municate with the talent either through the AUX 1-6 
[87] Sends, or the MAIN L/R [82] outputs. Connect an 
external microphone to the TALKBACK MIC XLR [81] 
connector on the rear panel to use the talkback feature.

52. TALKBACK ASSIGN Switches

These switches route the talkback signal to vari-
ous outputs, including AUX 1-2, AUX 3-4, AUX 5-6, and 
MAIN MIX outputs. You might use a pair of Aux Sends 
to communicate with musicians on-stage through their 
monitors during a live performance. These could be 
floor wedges or in-ear monitors.

By the way, it is okay to have more than one TB ASSIGN 
switch pushed in at the same time. The talkback signal 
will be routed to all the destinations you have selected. 
But if you don’t have any of the assign switches pushed 
in, the talkback signal won’t go anywhere, and you will 
wonder why everyone seems to be ignoring you.

53. TALKBACK Level Control

Use this knob to control the level of the talkback 
signal being routed to the AUX or MAIN L/R outputs.

54. TALKBACK Switch

This is a latching switch, meaning it’s always active 
when the switch is pushed in. As long as the switch is 
engaged, the talkback signal is routed to the outputs 
determined by the talkback assign switches [52]. Push 
the switch again to release it, and the talkback circuit is 
turned off. An LED above the switch indicates when the 
TALKBACK switch is active.

Auxiliary Section
This section includes the AUX SEND MASTERS and 

the STEREO RETURNS. These can be a bit confusing 
to the uninitiated, so here’s the whole idea behind aux 
sends and returns: sends are outputs and returns are 
inputs. AUX SENDs tap signals off the channels, via the 
AUX knobs [12/25], mix these signals together, then 
send them out the AUX SEND jacks [87].

These outputs are fed to the inputs of an external 
processor like a reverb or digital delay. From there, the 
mono or stereo outputs of the external device are fed 
back to the mixer’s STEREO RETURN jacks [80]. These 
signals are sent through the STEREO RETURN LEVEL 
controls [64], and finally delivered to the MAIN MIX 
bus.

So, the original “dry” signals go from the channels to 
the MAIN MIX and the affected “wet” signals go from the 
STEREO RETURNS to the MAIN MIX, and once mixed 
together, the dry and wet signals combine to create a 
glorious sound!

The AUX SENDS can also be used to provide an-
other mix for stage monitors. In this case, the STEREO 
RETURNS aren’t used to return the signal. Instead, they 
can be used as additional stereo inputs.

Aux Send Masters Section

55. AUX SEND MASTERS

The AUX SEND MASTERS provide overall control 
over the AUX SEND levels, just before they are delivered 
to the AUX SEND outputs [87]. These knobs go from off 
(∞) to +15 dB when turned all the way up.

When using the Aux Send for monitors, this is usu-
ally the knob you turn up when the lead singer glares at 
you, points at his stage monitor, and sticks his thumb up 
in the air. (It would follow that if the singer stuck his 
thumb down, you’d turn the knob down, but that never 
happens.)

56. PRE/POST Switch

This switch is used to select whether the Aux send 
signal is pre-fader or post-fader. 

When the PRE/POST switch is up, the Aux send 
signal is pre-fader, which is usually used for sending to 
monitors (stage monitor wedges or IEM, in-ear monitor 
systems). This way, when changes are made to fader 
levels in the front-of-house mix, it doesn’t affect the 
monitor mix.

When the PRE/POST switch is pushed in, the Aux 
send signal is post-fader, which is usually used when

60. TO MON/PHONES Switch

Press this switch to route the CD/TAPE signal to the 
Monitor and Phones outputs when there are no solo 
switches engaged. The Main Mix and CD/TAPE signal 
is overridden in the Monitor and Phones outputs by any 
PFL or AFL solo.

61. BREAK (TAPE TO MAIN)

Press this switch to route the CD/TAPE signal to 
the Main outputs. This actually disconnects the Main 
Mix signal from the Main outputs and replaces it with 
the CD/TAPE signal. This allows you to easily start up 
recorded music during a break without having to mute 
or turn down the faders on all the channels.

The patch point for the BREAK switch is prior to the 
MAIN INSERTS, the COMPRESSOR (if selected), and 
the MAIN MIX fader.

62. STEREO RETURNS AUX Sends

These tap a portion of the STEREO RETURNS signal 
out to AUX 1-4. This allows you to send a processed 
signal out to another processor if you want, or to add a 
processed signal to a monitor mix, or to use the Stereo 
Return as a stereo input and still be able to send the 
signal to an external processor or stage monitor.

FEEDBACK LOOP WARNING: It is 
common to use an Aux Send to route 
signals to an external processor, and 
then return the signal from the pro-
cessor via the Stereo Returns. Since 

the Stereo Returns on the Onyx 4•Bus have Aux Sends 
of their own, you could accidentally route the Stereo 
Return signal to an Aux Send that is being returned via 
that same Stereo Return. This will cause a feedback loop, 

characterized by 
a LOUD howl or 
screech through 
the sound system, 
followed by howls 
of discontent from 
the audience. Be 
careful with the 
Aux Sends on the 
Stereo Returns!

you are using the Aux send to go to an effects processor. 
This way, when fader changes are made, the “wet” signal 
going to the effects processor moves up and down along 
with the “dry” signal, maintaining a balance between 
them.

The pre-fader Aux Sends are post-EQ by default. How-
ever, an internal jumper is provided on each channel to 
change the pre-fader Aux Sends to pre-EQ, if desired. 
This requires some soldering skills, so contact Tech Sup-
port for information on how to access the pre/post-EQ 
jumpers for the Aux Sends.

57. AFL Solo Switch

The AFL switch allows you to hear the Aux Send sig-
nal through your headphones or monitor outputs. This 
comes after the Aux Send GAIN control, so you can hear 
the relative signal level on each Aux Send.

Remember, PFL solo mode always overrides AFL solo 
mode. If you engage a PFL solo switch on a mono or 
stereo channel, the AFL solo is disconnected from the 
headphones and monitor outputs and replaced with the 
PFL signal. The Rude Solo LEDS below the SOLO meters 
indicate which solo mode is active.

58. MUTE

Press this switch to mute the Aux Send output. When 
the MUTE switch is pushed in on an Aux Send, you can 
still solo the Aux Send.

59. CD/TAPE Level Control

This knob controls the level of the signals connected 
to the left and right TAPE IN jacks. The signal is then 
sent to the MONITOR/PHONES output (when the TO 
MON/PHONES switch [60] is pushed in) and the MAIN 
OUT (when the 
BREAK switch 
[61] is pushed 
in). The CD/TAPE 
level control pro-
vides 10 dB of ad-
ditional gain when 
turned fully up.

s 63. SHIFT Switch

The Stereo Returns have two Aux Send controls. 
When the SHIFT switch is up, they route the signal to 
Aux 1 and Aux 2, and when the switch is down, they 
route the signal to Aux 3 and Aux 4.

64. STEREO RETURNS LEVEL Control

This controls the level of the Stereo Return signal 
being sent to the Main Mix bus. It ranges from off to 
+10 dB of additional gain when turn fully clockwise.

65. PFL Solo Switch

Like the PFL switch on the stereo channels, this 
switch allows you to hear signals through your head-
phones or monitor outputs without having to route them 
to the Main Mix. Since this is Pre-Fader Listen, you can 
listen to the Stereo Return signal even 
when the Stereo Returns Level control is 
turned down. The Stereo Returns PFL is a 
stereo signal, and therefore retains its left 
and right stereo image in the headphones 
and monitors, and appears on both LEFT 
and RIGHT meters.

Group Section
There are four group masters (or sub-

masters, if you prefer) that feed the four 
group outs [85].

66. PAN

Note: The Group PAN control works 
only when the MAIN MIX switch is en-
gaged [70].

PAN adjusts the amount of signal sent 
to the left versus the right outputs.

With the PAN knob hard left, the signal 
feeds the MAIN LEFT output, and with 
the knob hard right, the signal feeds the 
MAIN RIGHT output.

67. MUTE Switch

Press this switch to mute the Group 
output. When the MUTE switch is pushed 
in on a Group, you can still solo the Group 
signal (see AFL Solo Switch [71] ahead), 
but it is muted at the Group output [85], 
the Main output [82](when  the MAIN 
MIX assign switch is pushed in), and the 
Matrix output [77].

68. GROUP Fader

This fader controls the Group’s signal level, from off to 
unity gain at the “U” marking, on up to 10 dB of addi-
tional gain.

69. Signal Level LEDs

These LEDs indicate the Group’s signal level after 
the Fader, but before the MUTE switch. So if the Group 
Fader is down, the Signal Level LEDs won’t light.

70. MAIN MIX Assign Switch

Push in this switch to send the Group signal to the left 
and right MAIN OUTS. When the PAN control is centered, 
the signal is sent equally to the left and right outputs.

The signal sent to the MAIN OUTS is after the Group 
Insert, Fader, and MUTE switch.

71. AFL Solo Switch

The AFL switch allows you to hear the Group signal 
through your headphones or monitor outputs. This 
comes after the Group Fader and before the MUTE 
switch, so you can hear the relative signal level on each 
Group even when they are muted.

When you engage the AFL switch on two consecu-
tive odd/even Groups (i.e., 1 and 2, 3 and 4), the soloed 
signal appears in stereo in the headphones and monitor 
outputs. This is useful when you are using a pair of Group 
Sends in stereo to feed an in-ear monitoring system.

Remember, PFL solo mode always overrides AFL solo 
mode. If you engage a PFL solo switch on a mono or 
stereo channel, the AFL solo is disconnected from the 
headphones and monitor outputs and replaced with the 
PFL signal. The Rude Solo LEDS below the SOLO meters 
indicate which solo mode is active.

72. MAIN MIX Fader

This is the master fader that control the levels at the 
MAIN OUTS.

When MAIN TO MON [51] is selected in the PHONES/
MONITOR Section, the MAIN MIX fader also controls the 
main mix level in the PHONES and MONITOR outputs 
[46/78].

When the fader is fully down, the MAIN MIX is off. 
The “U” marking indicates unity gain, and fully up pro-
vides 10 dB of additional gain. Typically, this fader is set 
near the “U” label and left alone, but it can be used for 
song fade-outs or quick system-wide mutes.

Rear Panel
This is where all the connections are made to the 

Onyx 4•Bus (except the headphones and lamps).

73. MIC Input

This is a female XLR connector, which accepts a bal-
anced microphone input from almost any type of micro-
phone. The microphone preamps feature our new Onyx 
design, with higher fidelity and headroom rivaling any 
standalone mic preamp on the market today.

The XLR inputs are wired as follows: 
 Pin 1 = Shield or ground 
 Pin 2 = Positive (+ or hot) 
 Pin 3 = Negative (– or cold)

The MIC inputs can accept a balanced line-level input 
when the PAD [1] switch on the channel strip is pushed 
in (the input impedance is lower than the LINE input).

74. LINE Input

This is a 1/4" TRS connector, which accepts a balanced or 
unbalanced line-level input signal from almost any source.

When connecting a balanced signal to the LINE inputs, 
wire them as follows: 
 Tip = Positive (+ or hot) 
 Ring = Negative (– or cold) 
 Sleeve = Shield or ground

When connecting an unbalanced signal, wire them as 
follows: 
 Tip = Positive (+ or hot) 
 Sleeve = Shield or ground

s 75. INSERT

These 1/4" TRS jacks provide a send and return point 
for each channel. Use the INSERT jacks to connect 
serial effects devices such as compressors, equalizers, 
de-essers, or filters to each individual channel.

The INSERT points are after the GAIN and Low Cut 
controls, but before the EQ and Fader controls. The 
send (tip) is low-impedance, capable of driving any 
device. The return (ring) is high-impedance and can be 
driven by almost any device.

Special insert cables are available, specially designed 
for this kind of insert jack. They are wired as follows:

“from tip”

this plug connects to one of the 
mixer’s Channel Insert jacks. “to ring”

tip
ring

sleeve

SEND to processor

RETURN from processor

(TRS plug)

 Tip = Send (output to effects device) 
 Ring = Return ( input from effects device) 
 Sleeve = Common ground (connect shield to all  
 three sleeves)

Besides being used for inserting external devices, 
these jacks can also be used as channel direct outputs; 
post-GAIN, post-LOW CUT, and pre-EQ. This is an unbal-
anced direct out, in contrast to the DIRECT OUTS on 
the rear panel, which are balanced direct outputs, post-
GAIN, post-INSERT, and pre-EQ.

Here are three ways you use the INSERT jacks:

Direct out with no signal interruption to master.
Insert only to first “click.”

Channel Insert jack

Channel Insert jack

Channel Insert jack

Direct out with signal interruption to master.
Insert all the way in to the second “click.”

For use as an effects loop.
(TIP = SEND to effect, RING = RETURN from effect)

76. DIRECT OUTS

Each of these DB-25 connectors provides balanced 
direct outputs for eight channels. They are designed to 
be connected directly to a recorder’s analog inputs, and 
use the TASCAM standard pinout for analog signal con-
nections (the same standard used on the analog cards 
for the Mackie D8B, DXB, and Hard Disk Recorder).

The signal at the DIRECT OUTS comes after the input 
GAIN control, Low-Cut switch, and INSERT jack, but 
before the EQ. This way you can EQ a channel and ad-
just the channel fader to suit your live mix, but it has no 
effect on the signal going to the recorder. This provides 
maximum flexibility for the mixdown stage.

Internal jumpers are provided to change the DIRECT 
OUTS to post-EQ on a channel-by-channel basis, if 
desired. This requires some soldering skills, so contact 
Tech Support for information on how to access the 
pre/post-EQ jumpers for the DIRECT OUTS.

See Appendix B for a wiring diagram of the DIRECT OUT 
connectors.

77. MATRIX OUT

These 1/4" TRS jacks provide balanced line-level sig-
nals for the MATRIX A and B mixes. These can be con-
nected to the inputs of an amplifier, powered speaker, 
headphone distribution amplifier, or recording device.

81. MON(ITOR) OUT

These 1/4" TRS jacks provide a balanced line-level signal 
that can be used to provide another main mix output (with 
MAIN TO MON [51] selected in the PHONES/MONITOR 
Section), or to monitor soloed channels.

Connect these outputs to the inputs of an amplifier, 
powered speaker, headphone distribution amplifier, or 
recording device.

82. LEFT/RIGHT MAIN OUTS

There are two sets of outputs for the Left/Right Main 
Outputs: Male XLR connectors that provide balanced 
line-level signals and 1/4" TRS connectors that provide 
balanced or unbalanced line-level signals. Each XLR 
connector is in parallel with its corresponding 1/4" TRS 
connector, and carries exactly the same signal.

This represents the end of the mixer chain, where 
your fully mixed stereo signal enters the real world. 

Connect these to the inputs of your main power ampli-
fiers, powered speakers, or serial effects processor (like 
a graphic equalizer, or compressor/limiter if you are not 
using the built-in stereo compressor on the main outs).

83. MAIN INSERTS

These 1/4" TRS jacks are for connecting serial effects 
such as compressors, equalizers, deessers, or filters. 
The insert point is after the mix amps and BREAK [61] 
switch, but before the MAIN MIX faders and the built-in 
compressor. Refer to the description of the channel insert 
on the previous page to see how to make this connection.

84. MONO OUT

This male XLR output connector provides a balanced 
line-level signal that is a combination of the left and right 
MAIN OUT signals (L+R). You can use this for a separate 
mix that doesn’t require a stereo feed, or to simply test 
the monaural compatibility of your stereo mix.

85. GROUP OUTS 1-4

These 1/4" TRS output connectors provide balanced 
or unbalanced line-level signals for connecting to the 
inputs of any line-level device.

86. GROUP SEND INSERTS

These 1/4" TRS jacks are for connecting serial effects 
such as compressors, equalizers, deessers, or filters. The 
insert point is after the mix amps, but before the Group 
Send Masters (and before the built-in stereo compres-
sor). Refer to the description of the channel insert on 
the previous page to see how to make this connection.

any AC voltage ranging from 100 VAC to 240 VAC. No 
need for voltage select switches. It will work virtually 
anywhere in the world. That’s why we call it a “Planet-
Earth” power supply! This also means that it is less 
susceptible to voltage sags or spikes, providing greater 
electromagnetic isolation and better protection against 
AC line noise.

This one is self-explanatory. When the POWER switch 
is turned ON, power is supplied to the Onyx 4•Bus and 
the POWER LED on the front panel lights up.

Appendix A: Service Information
Warranty Service
Details concerning Warranty Service are spelled out in 
the Warranty section on page 35.

If you think your Onyx mixer has a problem, please 
do everything you can to confirm it before calling for 
service. Doing so might save you from the deprivation of 
your Onyx mixer and the associated suffering.

These may sound obvious to you, but here are some 
things you can check. Read on.

Troubleshooting
No Power

• Our favorite question: Is it plugged in?

• Make sure the power cord is securely seated in the 
IEC socket [89] and plugged all the way into the 
AC outlet.

• Make sure the AC outlet is live (check with a tester 
or lamp).

• Is the POWER [90] switch on? Make sure the 
POWER switch on the rear panel is in the ON posi-
tion (up).

• Is the POWER LED [44] on the front panel illumi-
nated? If not, make sure the AC outlet is live.

• Are all the lights out in your building? If so, contact 
your local power company to get power restored.

• If the POWER LED is not illuminated, and you are 
certain that the AC outlet is live, it will be necessary 
to have your Onyx 4•Bus serviced. There are no user 
serviceable parts inside. Refer to “Repair” at the end 
of this section to find out how to proceed.

Bad Channel

• Is the MUTE button [14/27] pushed in?

• Is the input GAIN control [4/19] for the channel 
turned up?

• Is the fader [15/28] turned up?

• Is the signal source turned up? Make sure the 
signal level from the selected input source is 
high enough to light up some of the INPUT meter 
[16/29] LEDs next to the channel’s fader.

• Is the channel assigned to a bus (GROUP ASSIGN 
or MAIN MIX button pushed in)?

• Is there something plugged into the CHANNEL 
INSERT jack [75]? Try unplugging any INSERT 
devices.

• Try the same source signal in another channel, set 
up exactly like the suspect channel.

Bad Output

• Is the associated level control (if any) turned up?

• If it’s one of the MAIN OUTPUTS, try unplugging all 
the others. For example, if it’s the 1/4" LEFT MAIN 
OUT, unplug the XLR LEFT OUTPUT. If the problem 
goes away, it’s not the mixer.

• If it’s a stereo pair, try switching them around. For 
example, if a left output is presumed dead, switch 
the left and right cords at the mixer end. If the 
problem stays on the left side, it’s not the mixer.

Bad Sound

• Is the input connector plugged completely into the 
jack?

• Is it loud and distorted? Make sure the input GAIN 
control for the input is set correctly. Reduce the 
signal level on the input source if possible.

• If possible, listen to the signal with headphones 
plugged into the input source device. If it sounds 
bad there, it’s not the Onyx 4•Bus causing the prob-
lem.

Noise/Hum

• Turn down the STEREO RETURN LEVEL controls 
[64]. If the noise disappears, it’s coming from what-
ever is plugged into the STEREO RETURNS [80].

• Turn down each channel, one by one. If the noise 
disappears, it’s coming from whatever is plugged 
into that channel.

• Check the signal cables between the input sources 
and the Onyx. Disconnect them one by one. When 
the noise goes away, you’ll know which input source 
is causing the problem.

• Sometimes it helps to plug all the audio equipment 
into the same AC circuit so they share a common 
ground.

s Repair

Service for Mackie products is available at a factory-
authorized service center. Service for Mackie products 
living outside the United States can be obtained through 
local dealers or distributors.

If your Onyx 4•Bus needs service, follow these instruc-
tions:

1. Review the preceding troubleshooting suggestions. 
Please.

2. Call Tech Support at 1-800-898-3211, 7 am to 5 pm 
PST, to explain the problem and obtain a Service 
Request Number. Have your serial number ready. 
You must have a Service Request Number before 
you can obtain service at the factory.

3. Keep this owner’s manual and the detachable line-
cord. We don’t need them to repair the mixer.

4. Pack the mixer in its original package, includ-
ing endcaps and box. This is VERY IMPORTANT. 
Mackie is not responsible for any damage that 
occurs due to non-factory packaging.

5. Include a legible note stating your name, shipping 
address (no P.O. boxes), daytime phone number, 
Service Request Number, and a detailed description 
of the problem, including how we can duplicate it.

6. Write the Service Request Number in BIG PRINT on 
top of the box. Units sent to us without the Service 
Request Number will be refused.

7. Tech Support will tell you where to ship the mixer 
for repair. We suggest insurance for all forms of 
cartage.

8. You will need to contact the authorized service 
center for their latest turn-around times. The mixer 
must be packaged in its original packing box, and 
must have the Service Request Number on the box. 
Once it’s repaired, the authorized service center will 
ship it back, pre-paid (if it was a warranty repair).

 Note: Under the terms of the warranty, you must 
ship or drop-off the unit to an authorized service 
center. The return ground shipment is covered for 
those units deemed by us to be under warranty.

 Note: You must have a sales receipt from an Autho-
rized Mackie Dealer to qualify for a warranty repair.

in many other applications. They are unbalanced and 
electrically equivalent to a 1/4" TS phone plug.

TIPSLEEVETIPSLEEVE

RCA Unbalanced Wiring:
Sleeve = Shield 
Tip = Hot (+)

Unbalancing a Line
In most studio, stage, and sound reinforcement situ-
ations, there is a combination of balanced and unbal-
anced inputs and outputs on the various pieces of 
equipment. This usually will not be a problem in making 
connections.

• When connecting a balanced output to an unbal-
anced input, be sure the signal high (hot) connec-
tions are wired to each other, and that the balanced 
signal low (cold) goes to the ground (earth) 
connection at the unbalanced input. In most cases, 
the balanced ground (earth) will also be connected 
to the ground (earth) at the unbalanced input. If 
there are ground-loop problems, this connection 
may be left disconnected at the balanced end.

XLR Connectors
The mono channels use 3-pin female XLR connectors 
on the MIC inputs. They are wired as follows, according 
to standards specified by the AES (Audio Engineering 
Society).

s • When connecting an unbalanced output to a bal-

anced input, be sure that the signal high (hot) 
connections are wired to each other. The unbal-
anced ground (earth) connection should be wired 
to the low (cold) and the ground (earth) connec-
tions of the balanced input. If there are ground-loop 
problems, try disconnecting the unbalanced ground 
(earth) connection from the balanced input ground 
(earth) connection, leaving the unbalanced ground 
connected to the balanced input low (cold) con-
nection only.

In some cases, you may have to make up special 
adapters to interconnect your equipment. For example, 
you may need a balanced XLR female connected to an 
unbalanced 1/4" TS phone plug. Many common adapters 
can be found at your local electronics supply store.

The balanced-to-unbalanced connection has been 
anticipated in the wiring of Mackie jacks. A 1/4" TS plug 
inserted into a 1/4" TRS balanced input, for example, 
will automatically unbalance the input and make all the 
right connections. Conversely, a 1/4" TRS plug inserted 
into a 1/4" unbalanced input will not necessarily tie the 
ring (low or cold) to ground (earth).

TRS Send/Receive Insert Jacks
Mackie’s single-jack inserts are three-conductor 1/4" 

TRS phone jacks. They are unbalanced, but have both 
the mixer output (send) and mixer input (return) 
signals in one connector.

The sleeve is the common ground (earth) for both 
signals. The send from the mixer to the external unit is 
carried on the tip, and the return from the unit to the 
mixer is on the ring.

“from tip”

this plug connects to one of the 
mixer’s Channel Insert jacks. “to ring”

SEND to processor

RETURN from processor

(TRS plug)

Using the Send Only on an Insert Jack

If you insert a 1/4" TS (mono) plug only partially (to 
the first click) into a Mackie insert jack, the plug will 
not activate the jack switch and will not open the insert 
loop in the circuit (thereby allowing the channel signal 
to continue on its merry way through the mixer).

This allows you to tap out the channel’s signal at that 
point in the circuit without interrupting normal operation.

Note: Do not overload or short-circuit 
the signal you are tapping from the 
mixer. That will affect the internal 
signal. 

If you push the 1/4"  TS plug in to the second click, 
you will open the jack switch and create a direct out, 
which does interrupt the signal in that channel.

Direct out with no signal interruption to master.
Insert only to first “click.”

Mults and “Y”s
A mult or “Y” connector allows you to route one output 

to two or more inputs by simply providing parallel wir-
ing connections. You can make “Y”s and mults for the 
outputs of both unbalanced and balanced circuits.

Remember: Only mult or “Y” an 
output into several inputs. If you need 
to combine several outputs into one 
input, you must use a mixer, not a 
mult or a “Y.”

DB25 Connectors
The DIRECT OUTS on the back of the Onyx 4•Bus 

provide balanced direct outputs for all the mono chan-
nels on female DB25 connectors. These connectors are 
pin-for-pin compatible with the analog (not TDIF) DB25 
connectors found on TASCAM DTRS recorders, which has 
become an industry standard for many professional audio 
manufacturers. They are also the same pinout as the ana-
log cards for the Mackie D8B and hard disk recorders.

Several companies make DB25-to-DB25 cables specifi-
cally for audio, with proper shielding to reduce crosstalk 
and noise.

DB25 cables that break out to XLR, 1/4" TRS, or TT 
connectors for connecting to other mixers or audio gear

A. LOUD Technologies Inc. warrants all materials, workmanship 
and proper operation of this product for a period of three years 
from the original date of purchase. If any defects are found 
in the materials or workmanship or if the product fails to 
function properly during the applicable warranty period, LOUD 
Technologies, at its option, will repair or replace the product. 
This warranty applies only to equipment sold and delivered 
within the U.S. by LOUD Technologies Inc. or its authorized 
dealers.
B. Failure to register online or return the product registration 
card will not void the three-year warranty.

C. Service and repairs of Mackie products are to be performed 
only at a factory-authorized facility (see D below). Unauthorized 
service, repairs, or modification will void this warranty. To obtain 
repairs under warranty, you must have a copy of your sales receipt 
from the authorized Mackie dealer where you purchased the 
product. It is necessary to establish purchase date and determine 
whether your Mackie product is within the warranty period. 

D. To obtain factory-authorized service:
1. Call Mackie Technical Support at 800/898-3211, 7 AM 
to 5 PM Monday through Friday (Pacific Time) to get a 
Service Request Number. Products returned without a Service 
Request Number will be refused. 

2. Pack the product in its original shipping carton. Also 
include a note explaining exactly how to duplicate the 
problem, a copy of the sales receipt with price and date 
showing, and your return street address (no P.O. boxes or 
route numbers, please!). If we cannot duplicate the problem 
or establish the starting date of your Limited Warranty, we 
may, at our option, charge for service time.

3. Ship the product in its original shipping carton, freight 
prepaid to the authorized service center. The address of 
your closest authorized service center will be given to you by 
Technical Support.

IMPORTANT:  Make sure that the Service Request Number 
is plainly written on the shipping carton.

E. LOUD Technologies reserves the right to inspect any products 
that may be the subject of any warranty claims before repair 
or replacement is carried out. LOUD Technologies may, at our 
option, require proof of the original date of purchase in the form 
of a dated copy of the original dealer’s invoice or sales receipt. 
Final determination of warranty coverage lies solely with LOUD 
Technologies. 

F. Any products returned to one of the LOUD Technologies 
factory-authorized service centers and deemed eligible for repair 
or replacement under the terms of this warranty will be repaired 
or replaced within thirty days of receipt. LOUD Technologies 
and its authorized service centers may use refurbished parts for 
repair or replacement of any product. Products returned to LOUD 
Technologies that do not meet the terms of this Warranty will be 
not be repaired unless payment is received for labor, materials, 
return freight, and insurance. Products repaired under warranty 
will be returned freight prepaid by LOUD Technologies to any 
location within the boundaries of the USA.

G. LOUD Technologies warrants all repairs performed for 90 
days or for the remainder of the warranty period. This warranty 
does not extend to damage resulting from improper installation, 
misuse, neglect or abuse, or to exterior appearance. This 
warranty is recognized only if the inspection seals and serial 
number on the unit have not been defaced or removed.

H. LOUD Technologies assumes no responsibility for the quality 
or timeliness of repairs performed by an authorized service 
center.

I. This warranty is extended to the original purchaser and to 
anyone who may subsequently purchase this product within the 
applicable warranty period. A copy of the original sales receipt is 
required to obtain warranty repairs.

J. This is your sole warranty. LOUD Technologies does not 
authorize any third party, including any dealer or sales 
representative, to assume any liability on behalf of LOUD 
Technologies or to make any warranty for LOUD Technologies Inc.

K. THE WARRANTY GIVEN ON THIS PAGE IS THE SOLE 
WARRANTY GIVEN BY LOUD TECHNOLOGIES INC. AND IS IN 
LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE WARRANTY 
GIVEN ON THIS PAGE SHALL BE STRICTLY LIMITED IN 
DURATION TO THREE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF ORIGINAL 
PURCHASE FROM AN AUTHORIZED MACKIE DEALER. UPON 
EXPIRATION OF THE APPLICABLE WARRANTY PERIOD, LOUD 
TECHNOLOGIES INC. SHALL HAVE NO FURTHER WARRANTY 
OBLIGATION OF ANY KIND. LOUD TECHNOLOGIES INC. 
SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT MAY RESULT FROM ANY 
DEFECT IN THE MACKIE PRODUCT OR ANY WARRANTY 
CLAIM. Some states do not allow exclusion or limitation of 
incidental, special, or consequential damages or a limitation on 
how long warranties last, so some of the above limitations and 
exclusions may not apply to you. This warranty provides specific 
legal rights and you may have other rights which vary from state 
to state.

Please keep your sales receipt in a safe place.
