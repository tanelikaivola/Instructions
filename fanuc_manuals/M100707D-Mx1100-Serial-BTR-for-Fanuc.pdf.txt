The History of the BTR 

 

The “Behind the Tape Reader” board, or BTR as it is commonly 

called, is an electronic signal processor designed to emulate the 

function of a paper Tape Reader and provide an RS232 serial port as 

an alternate method of data entry to an NC or CNC control. RS232 is 

an international standard for electronic communications, and is a 

faster and more reliable means of data input than using punch tape or 

Manual Data Input (MDI). Originally, the only one way that a part 

program (the “G-code”) could be entered into a machine tool was 

through MDI mode, which allowed the program to be input using a 

keypad at the control. The MDI process was fine for small programs, 

but it was time consuming and error prone for longer programs. It 



Introduction_ VI 

took time to set up and to prove the MDI code before operation could 

commence. Machine flexibility was low, since each new program 

required time to input. With all the wasted time and lack of 

flexibility, it was not very long before someone invented an alternate 

form of control input, the paper Tape Reader. 

 

The paper Tape Reader provided a faster, more reliable form of data 

input to the numerical control. However, these Tape Readers were 

mechanical in nature, and required regular maintenance and care to 

perform properly. Tape Readers allowed data and programs that were 

punched out on a paper tape to be read in by the control at a rate of 

approximately 300 to 400 characters per second. A few problems 

inherent in the Tape Reader are: it has limited ability to accept 

commands and inform the operator of problems and status; it is prone 

to mechanical problems; it requires cleaning, lubrication and other 

maintenance; it has a limited capacity of 1000 feet (305 metres) of 

tape. It was commonly suggested that a busy shop keep a spare 

reader in inventory in preparation for the time when one broke down. 

 

 
 

The process of punching data tapes (whether paper, Mylar or metal) 

was expensive, time-consuming and brought up storage concerns. 

Because of the absolute nature of a punched tape, the process had to 

be redone for every program revision. The programmer and operator 

had to work closely together to keep the tape accurate and up to date. 

Old tapes had to be filed or destroyed and the latest version had to be 

carefully marked and stored. Finally, the tape itself had to be handled 

with care since it was prone to damage.  

  

Later machine controls had a new mode of operation that allowed 

their Tape Reader’s “endless” spool of tape to surmount memory 

constraints. Originating on Numerical Controls (NC) that had no 

memory, Direct Numeric Control (DNC) allowed execution of a 

program while it was being read. This “drip-feed” method meant that 

the program was limited in size only by the length of tape used. This 



Introduction_ VII 

type of operation was very much appreciated later on with the advent 

of Computerized Numeric Controls (CNC). 

 

With true onboard memory the CNC had much greater capabilities 

and inevitably programs got longer and the need for more memory 

grew. With control memory being expensive and limited, DNC has 

remained the only way some modern manufacturers can operate. 

Tape Readers are still commonplace on modern controls today. 

However, thanks to serial DNC capabilities, many shops use Tape 

Readers for backup purposes only. 

 

The modern equivalent of a Tape Reader is the BTR interface board, 

which emulates paper Tape Readers. The Mx1100 UMI BTR is a 

microcontroller-based interface board that allows communications 

with a machine control for the purposes of loading programs into 

memory or running DNC. BTRs generally connect to a computer and 

permit a programmer to send a complete, formatted program to the 

machine control. The machine then loads the program as if from 

tape, either to memory for later execution, or for immediate block-

by-block execution (DNC). Because the Mx1100 UMI BTR emulates 

the Tape Reader, the control really has no way of knowing that the 

source of the program is a computer port instead of a tape. 

  

The Mx1100 UMI BTR eliminates punching of tape, has no moving 

parts, can handle transfer speeds that exceed that of a Tape Reader, 

uses the programmed (source) file, is less expensive than a Tape 

Reader, allows the Tape Reader to still be used, supports the use of 

the control’s punch capability, and does not require maintenance. It’s 

no wonder that the BTR, in combination with DNC software, has 

become the preferred alternative to using the Tape Reader and (in 

many cases) to upgrading CNC memory. 

  

While the Memex BTR gives the machine control the ability to 

receive programs from a PC, it has nothing to do with the specifics of 

what is being sent to the control. DNC software, or at the very least 

some form of serial communications software, is responsible for 

transmitting the data to the control, and the control expects that data 

to be in a specific format. The part program must be formatted just as 

it would be for punching to tape, and the DNC software must be 

configured to send it as if it were a tape. The BTR acts only as a 

gateway or port to the control. The required program format is 

usually described in the control’s Operations Manual. Please consult 

the manual for information on how to configure the part code 

programs for the control.

Before You Begin 

 

Please read all instructions before proceeding. We recommended first 

making a temporary installation, becoming familiarized with the 

components and orientation of the assembly, testing the functionality, 

and then making the installation permanent by mounting the BTR and 

routing and securing the cables where they are out of harm’s way.

Chapter 1: Installation Instructions _ 2 
 

Installing the Mx1100 UMI BTR 
 

General 

 

The Memex Mx1100 UMI BTR installation procedure is 

straightforward and relatively easy to complete – connect the BTR to 

the CNC where the Tape Reader was connected, optionally connect 

the Tape Reader to the BTR, and mount the BTR on the inside of the 

Tape Reader door. All the hardware and accessories are provided. All 

that’s needed are some basic skills and hand tools. Estimated time 

required: 45 minutes. 

 

1. Prepare the site. 
Ensure that the Tape Reader and control are working properly 

before beginning the installation. When ready, turn OFF all power 

to the control, machine and computer system. 

 

2. Access the Tape Reader. 
Locate the panel on the control that has the Tape Reader mounted 

on it. Open this door to gain access to the back of the Reader. 

 

3. Disconnect the Tape Reader. 
Locate the Tape Reader printed circuit board directly behind the 

Reader. It has two 50-pin connectors, labelled CNT1 and CNT2. 

The second (CNT2) has wires going to the Tape Reader head. The 

cable on CNT1 is a 50-conductor ribbon cable that goes to the 

CNC. Note which side of this connector the cable’s red stripe 

goes on. Disconnect this cable from CNT1. 

 

4. Connect the BTR. 
Connect the cable disconnected in Step 3 to the BTR’s 50-pin 

connector at top right*, labelled “FANUC CONTROL A”, 

without twisting the cable. Make sure the cable’s red stripe is on 

the left, where Pin 1 is marked with a white square (see diagram, 

page 6). This connects the BTR’s Fanuc control port to the 

control. 

 

Caution 

 It is very important that the cables are installed 

properly with the correct orientation. If one of the 

cables is plugged in upside down, severe damage will 

occur to the BTR, to the Tape Reader and to the 

control’s Master Board. 



Chapter 1: Installation Instructions _ 3 
 

5. Mount the BTR. 

Locate a safe spot on the back of the door and magnetically 

mount the Mx1100 UMI BTR.  

 

6. Option: Connect the Tape Reader to the BTR. 
If you wish to enable the paper Tape Reader, take the new 50-

conductor ribbon cable and plug it onto the JP5 connector 

(labelled “FANUC TAPE READER A”) at the bottom right of 

the BTR.*  The red side of the cable goes on pin 1 of the 

connector  (see diagram, page 6). Plug the other end of the cable 

onto the CNT1 connector on the Fanuc Tape Reader board, from 

which the cable was removed in Step 3 – ensuring the red wire on 

the ribbon cable goes on pin 1 of the connector, as noted in Step 

3. 

 

7. Option: Punch Cable. 
If you would like to punch part programs, parameters, etc. from 

the control to the computer, and you have purchased the optional 

Fanuc Facit 4070 Punch Cable, connect the control’s punch port 

to the BTR. Locate the punch port on the control. It’s usually a 

blue rectangular 20-pin (Honda) connector. Plug the Punch Cable 

into this port. Plug the 26-pin end onto the BTR’s JP4 connector, 

labelled “PUNCH IN”. The red stripe goes on the side with Pin 1 

(see diagram on page 6). Remove the JP17 jumper (labelled 

“PUNCH DISABLE”) in the upper right corner of the BTR. 

 

8. Configure the BTR. 
Set the jumpers on the BTR to configure the communications 

parameters required for your DNC system. The option jumpers, 

listed on page 17, include the following: 

 

Jumper A1 and A2 set the Baud rate. Typically 9600 baud 

(both jumpers ON) is used unless your cable doesn’t support 

that rate reliably. The RS232 specification supports 9600 

Baud (Even parity, 7 data bits and 1 stop bit) with a cable 

length up to 50 feet (15 metres), but it is often possible to 

exceed that. It’s important to use cable specifically designed 

for RS232 serial data, 22 AWG, twisted pair, stranded wire 

(not solid), shielded, low capacitance (a rating of 11 to 15 pF 

per foot) is best. If you have a long cable run or are have 

unreliable data transmission, try lowering the Baud rate.     
Note: 

 

 In our opinion, CAT3 or CAT5 UTP Ethernet cable is not suitable for 

reliable machine tool serial communications. Use shielded cable. 

 



Chapter 2: Operating the Mx1100 _ 4 
 

Jumper A3 OFF adds hardware (RTS/CTS) handshaking. 

A3 ON is software (Xon/Xoff) only. Generally it is preferable 

to use both, which means setting A3 OFF and making sure 

your cable supports hardware handshaking (see Note 6 on p 9). 

 

Jumper A4 OFF uses the standard Xoff character, $13 Hex. 

Set A4 ON if your terminal software uses $93 Hex for Xoff. 

 

Jumper A5 OFF uses the standard Xon/Xoff handshaking 

method (a Single Xoff). Setting A5 ON sends a continuous 

stream of Xoff back to the computer until the next Xon. This 

enables the BTR to be used with some terminal programs that 

were intended for use with a modem, such as PROCOMM ™ 

although we recommend the use of proper DNC software. 

 

Jumper A6 OFF will echo incoming data back to the PC for 

diagnostic purposes. On reset, the software version is 

outputted for instance. Set A6 ON for normal use. 

 

Jumper A7 OFF is ISO data, and ON converts incoming ISO 

data to EIA format for controls that require EIA data. 

 

Jumper A8 overrides the Tape Reader’s selection of BTR or 

Tape mode. If the Tape Reader wasn’t reconnected to the 

BTR, or if the Tape Reader isn’t intended to be used often and 

the BTR will usually in Tape mode, set A8 ON. (Remember to 

remove it when a tape needs to be read.) 

__________________________________________________ 

SG JMPR OFF = COM1 Signal Ground surge suppression. 

 

PWR P9 DBL ON activates power output on COM1’s pin 9, 

for use with devices such as buffers (see note on page 18). 

 

Punch Disable – if you are not using a Facit 4070 punch port 

(SKU-5100 cable), keep this jumper ON. 

 

9. Connect to the Computer. 
Connect a serial cable from the 9-pin COM1 on the BTR to the 

computer’s serial port (see page 18 for cable configurations). 

 

10. Test the Functionality. 
Refer to “Operating the Mx1100 UMI BTR” (page 5), and if 

necessary, “Reference” (page 7). 

 

  



Chapter 2: Operating the Mx1100 _ 5 
 

Operating the Mx1100 UMI BTR 
 

 

To use the control’s new serial port: 

Make sure the cables are connected correctly and prepare your DNC 

software. Press Reset on the Fanuc control to reset the BTR and ensure 

that no residual data is present in its input buffer. If BTR option jumper 

A8 is OFF (switch enabled), and the Tape Reader is connected, switch 

the BTR into BTR mode either by turning off the Tape Reader or by 

switching the Tape Reader to Release mode. Start an upload to the 

control from your DNC software, and then load a program at the 

control as if from tape. You can put the control in Tape mode and press 

READ or INPUT to load the program into memory (if it will fit), or put 

the control in DNC (or External) mode and press Cycle Start to run it in 

DNC mode – also known as “drip feeding”. (These mode names and 

key names will vary according to the control model.) 

 

If you have any difficulty or concerns, please refer to “General 

Troubleshooting” on page 7. 

 

 

 

Helpful hints 

 

 Adding a couple of Carriage Returns to the end of the file will 
ensure that the entire file is transmitted. Some combinations of 

DNC software and CNC control sometimes miss the end of a 

file, so it’s a good idea to provide some harmless extra 

characters as a buffer. 

 

 The BTR responds to the Break character by resetting and 
clearing its buffer. The Break character is ASCII value 3, or 

HEX 03 (see Appendix B, page 19). If your DNC software can 

be configured to send control codes, it’s a good idea to have it 

send a Break character at the beginning of every g-code 

program it sends. This will guarantee that the BTR buffer is 

reset and ready for a new program each time, regardless of 

whether the CNC didn’t properly finish reading the previous 

one. (The Break character will not be passed through to the 

CNC, and the start of the program following it will wait while 

the BTR is resetting.)

General Troubleshooting 

 

The Mx1100 UMI BTR is designed to install easily and quickly. 

However, if experiencing difficulty in the procedures, please check the 

following to isolate and resolve the problem: 

 

1. Check that the “PWR ON” LED on the BTR (leftmost LED in 
the LED block at bottom centre*) is on and bright. 
The RTS LED for COM1 should also be on. If there is no power to 

the BTR, ensure that the cables from the Control (and from the 

Tape Reader if connected) are oriented properly and are well 

secured. Also, check that one of the following is true: 

a) The “+5TR” jumper (JP18 at bottom right) is ON and the 
“+24TR” jumper (JP16 at middle left) and “REG ENBL” 

(JP10 near middle bottom) are OFF;  -or- 

b) The “+5TR” jumper (JP18) is OFF and the “+24TR” jumper 
(JP16) and “REG ENBL” (JP10) are ON 

In case “a” above, the BTR is sourcing 5 volts from the CNC; in 

case “b” it is sourcing 24 volts and reducing it to 5 volts. 

Typically 5V (setting “a”) is used with a Fanuc control. 

 

NOTE: The default power source setting is “a” above, 5 volts. 

However, in some CNCs the 5-volt supply has faded to below the 

threshold that will power the BTR. If the BTR won’t power on, try 

using 24 volts by setting the jumpers as in “b” above. 

 

2.    Alternate source of power 

If the PWR LED still does not come on, carefully find a source of        

power on the control between 7 and 24VDC and wire it in to 

screw-down terminal block J7 at the lower left corner of the BTR 

When power is brought in through the terminal block, the jumpers 

must be set as in “b” above. 

 

 
Note:

3. Check that the BTR is working properly. 
When the control is powered up or reset, the BTR’s STATUS LED 

(2
nd

 LED in LED block at middle bottom) should blink. One blink 

indicates that the Mx1100 is in BTR Mode. This means that it is 

ready to receive information through the serial port and to send it 

to the control. Two blinks indicate that the Mx1100 is in TAPE 

Mode. This means that it is ready to pass information through the 

BTR from the Tape Reader to the Control. (The leftmost TX LED 

will also blink, as the BTR sends out a status message on its 

COM1 port during power up.) With most Tape Readers, turning 

the Tape Reader on/off or switching it between Load and Release 

will switch the BTR between modes. 

 

4. Check the status message. 
When the BTR is powered on or reset, it sends a short message on 

its COM1 port, indicating which mode it’s in. The STATUS and 

first TX LEDs will blink during output. If the computer is properly 

connected, and your DNC software is configured to match the 

BTR communication settings and is set to receive a file, it should 

be possible to capture and read the status message. If the message 

is clearly readable then the BTR’s communications are good, and 

so is the cable, the settings, the computer and the DNC software. 

NOTE: Some versions of the BTR require the A6 Jumper to be 

off (echo enabled) for the status message to be sent back to the 

PC on Power Up 

 

5. The Status and Tx LEDs flash but there is no status message.  
First the computer has to be watching for the status message with 

DNC software, or at least with a terminal program or utility. After 

installing your software, verify that the correct communication 

parameters are set and check that the correct computer COM port 

is being used. Check that the BAUD RATE is properly set and 

matches the baud rate on the BTR (check option jumpers A1 and 

A2 – see pg. 17) and that the STOP BITS are set to 1. Make sure 

that the cable connecting the BTR to the computer is a properly 

configured RS-232 serial data cable and that it is properly 

connected (see Step 6 below). Also verify that the PC’s COM port 

is functioning properly. 

 



Chapter 2: Operating the Mx1100 _ 9 
 

6. Check the serial data cable and handshaking settings. 
First, make sure the cable matches the appropriate diagram under 

“Mx1100 UMI BTR Cable Configurations” (page 18). 

 

Second, make sure the cable, BTR settings and software settings 

match with regard to handshaking method. If using software 

handshaking (Xon/Xoff) only (see table A on page 18), make sure 

that BTR Jumper A3 is ON and your DNC software is set for 

Xon/Xoff handshaking only. If using hardware handshaking (see 

table B on page 18), make sure that BTR Jumper A3 is OFF, your 

DNC software is set for RTS/CTS and Xon/Xoff handshaking, and 

the cable supports it by having the wires for RTS and CTS 

connected for a total of five wires connected at each end. (Note: 

Software handshaking can be used with a hardware handshaking 

cable, but not the other way around.) 

 

Third, make sure every wire connection at each end of the cable is 

solid, there are no breaks in the wires, no wire insulation is pulled 

back far enough to allow bare wire to touch another wire or any 

other metal parts, and no solder or debris is touching more than 

one pin. If everything looks good at the ends, it may be necessary 

to use a multi-meter to determine whether there is a break or a 

short in the wires somewhere along the length of the cable. 

If a hardware handshaking cable is being used, the leftmost CTS 

LED (in the STATUS LED bank at bottom centre of the BTR) will 

light up when a properly configured cable is connected between 

the BTR and a computer and both are powered on. The leftmost 

RTS LED will always be on, indicating that the BTR is active and 

the port is ready. Regardless of which type of handshaking is being 

used, the leftmost RX LED will blink when data is sent to the 

BTR, and the leftmost TX LED will blink during any Xon/Xoff 

handshaking that might occur during the send.  

 

7. The whole file sends before pressing Cycle Start. 
The most common cause of this is incorrect handshaking settings. 

Refer to Note 6 above. In addition, some terminal programs expect 

the XOFF character, normally Hex 13, to include even parity, 

making it Hex 93. Try setting jumper A4 ON (see page 17). 

 



Chapter 2: Operating the Mx1100 _ 10 
 

8. A CNC error occurs shortly after pressing “Cycle Start”. 
Try removing the CR (carriage return) characters from the 

program. Some controls only accept “pure” ISO or EIA code, 

which does not contain CR characters. Also try changing BTR 

jumper A7 in case it’s a matter of ISO / EIA format mismatch. 

 

9. The control generates a Tape Vertical (TV) alarm. 
Tape Vertical checking was a way that controls verified the 

accuracy of the program code they read in through the Tape 

Reader. It is usually an option and does not apply when you are 

using a BTR. Turn this option off in the control’s parameters. 

 

10. The control generates a Tape Horizontal (TH) alarm. 
Tape Horizontal is equivalent to Even parity. Use Even parity 

when sending the programs from the terminal or PC. Also see 

Notes 7 and 8 above – jumper A4 and/or A7 may resolve this. 

 

11. The Power LED lights but the STATUS LED doesn’t flash. 
Check the supply voltage to the BTR. If using a 5VDC supply and 

it is less than 4.6VDC, the BTR may actually be protecting itself 

from under-voltage. Find a better 5V supply, or switch to 24V (see 

Note 1 “b”) or use the screw-down terminal in the bottom left 

corner with a supply of 7 to 24VDC. Always be sure to set up the 

power jumpers correctly (see Notes 1 and 2). 

 

12. Other machine errors 
Ensure that the proper tape codes are being used at the beginning 

and/or end of the program. Some machines require a “%” (percent 

sign) as the first and/or last character in the program. Check the 

CNC Operator’s Manual for any termination characters that may 

be required. 

 

13. What if the BTR “Locks Up”? 
Near the upper left corner of the BTR are the four pins labelled 

RESET and LOAD. Of those four pins, the top two are the reset 

pins. Momentarily shorting the two RESET pins by touching them 

with a metal object such as a screwdriver or coin (while the power 

is on) will reset the BTR and make the STATUS LED flash. This 

action is the equivalent of pressing the reset button on a PC. This 

should not have to be done on a regular basis, but, as with anything 

electronic, lockup can happen.
