The peripheral units, such as the control unit and CRT/MDI, have been
designed on the assumption that they are housed in closed cabinets.  In
this manual “cabinet” refers to the following:

� Cabinet manufactured by the machine tool builder for housing the
control unit or peripheral units;

� Cabinet for housing the flexible turnkey system provided by FANUC;

� Operation pendant, manufactured by the machine tool builder, for
housing the CRT/MDI unit or operator’s panel.

� Equivalent to the above.

The environmental conditions when installing these cabinets shall
conform to the following table.  Section 3.4 describes the installation and
design conditions of a cabinet satisfying these conditions.

Room temperature
In operation 0� to 45�

Room  temperature
In storage or transportation –20� to 60�

Change in 
temperature 1.1°C/minute max.

Relative humidity
Normal 75% or less

Relative  humidity
Temporary (within 1 month) 95% or less

Vibration In operation: 0.5G or less

Environment

Normal machine shop environment
(The environment must be considered if the cabinets
are in a location where the density of dust, coolant,
and/or organic solvent is relatively high.)

Room temperature
In operation 0°C to +55°C

Room  temperature
In storage or transportation –20°C to +60°C

Relative humidity 95% RH or less (no condensation)

Vibration 0.5 G or less

Environment The unit shall not be exposed direct to cutting oil, lu-
bricant or cutting chips.

The power capacity of the CNC control unit, which in this section means
the specification required for the power supply, is obtained by adding the
power capacity of the control section and the power capacity of the servo
section.
The power capacity of the control section includes the power capacity of
the control unit, CRT/MDI.

Power capacity of
the control section

0.4 kVA

Power capacity of
the servo section

Depends on servo motor type.

When a cabinet is designed, it must satisfy the environmental conditions
described in Section 3.1.  In addition, the magnetic interference on the
CRT screen, noise resistance, and maintenance requirements  must be
considered.  The cabinet design must meet the following conditions :

� The cabinet must be fully closed.

The cabinet must be designed to prevent the entry of airborne dust,
coolant, and organic solvent.

Cabinets that let in air may be designed for the servo amplifier and
servo transformer provided that they :

� Use an air filter on the air inlet ;

� Place the ventilating fan so that it does not blow air directly toward
the unit;

� Control the air flow so that no dust or coolant enters the air outlet

� The cabinet must be designed to maintain a difference in temperature
of 10°C or less between the air in the cabinet and the outside air when
the temperature in the cabinet increases.
See Section 3.5 for the details on thermal design of the cabinet.

� A  closed cabinet must be equipped with a fan to circulate the air
within.  
The fan must be adjusted so that the air moves at 0.5 m/sec along the
surface of each installed unit.

CAUTION
If the air blows directly from the fan to the unit, dust easily
adheres to the unit.  This may cause the unit to fail.

� For the air to move easily, a clearance of 100 mm is required between
each unit and the wall of the cabinet.

� Packing materials must be used for the cable port and the door in order
to seal the cabinet.
Because the CRT unit uses a voltage of approximately 11 kV, airborne
dust gathers easily.  If the cabinet is insufficiently sealed, dust passes
through the gap and adheres to the unit.  This may cause the insulation
of the unit to deteriorate.
Acceptable packing materials :

� Epton sealer No. 686, NITTO INDUSTRY CO., LTD.

� Polyurethane foam (ester) covered with vinyl chloride, FUJI
POLYMERTECH., LTD.

� The CRT/MDI unit must be installed in a location where coolant
cannot be poured directly on it.  The unit does have a dust–proof front
panel.

� Noise must be minimized.
As the machine and the CNC unit are reduced in size, the parts that
generate noise may be placed near noise–sensitive parts in the
magnetics cabinet.
The CNC unit is built to protect it from external noise.  Cabinet design
to minimize noise generation and to prevent it from being transmitted
to the CNC unit is necessary.  See section 3.7 for details of noise
elimination/management.

� The units must be installed or arranged in the cabinet so that they are
easy to inspect and maintain.

� The CRT screen can be distorted by magnetic interference.
Arranging magnetic sources must be done with care.
If magnetic sources (such as transformers, fan motors,
electromagnetic contactors, solenoids, and relays) are located near the
CRT display, they frequently distort the display screen.  To prevent
this, the CRT display and the magnetic sources generally must be kept
300 mm apart.  If the CRT display and the magnetic sources are not
300 mm apart, the screen distortion may be suppressed by changing
the direction in which the magnetic sources are installed.
The magnetic intensity is not constant, and it is often increased by
magnetic interference from multiple magnetic sources interacting
with each other.  As a result, simply keeping the CRT and the magnetic
sources 300 mm apart may not be enough to prevent the distortion.
If they cannot be kept apart, or if the CRT screen remains distorted
despite the distance, cover the screen with a magnetic shield.

The purpose of the thermal design of the cabinet is to limit the difference
in temperature between the air in the cabinet and the outside air to 10°C
or less when the temperature in the cabinet increases.
The internal air temperature of the cabinet increases when the units and
parts installed in the cabinet generate heat.  Since the generated heat is
radiated from the surface of the cabinet, the temperature of the air in the
cabinet and the outside air balance at certain heat levels.   If the amount
of heat generated is constant, the larger the surface area of the cabinet, the
less the internal temperature rises.  The thermal design of the cabinet
refers to calculating the heat generated in the cabinet, evaluating the
surface area of the cabinet, and enlarging that surface area by installing
heat exchangers in the cabinet, if necessary.  Such a design method is
described in the following subsections.

The cooling capacity of a cabinet made of sheet metal is generally 6 W/°C
per 1m2 surface area, that is, when the 6W heat source is contained in a
cabinet having a surface area of 1 m2, the temperature of the air in the
cabinet rises by 1°C.  In this case the surface area of the cabinet  refers to
the area useful in cooling , that is, the area obtained by subtracting the area
of the cabinet touching the floor from the total surface area of the cabinet.
There are two preconditions : The air in the cabinet must be  circuited by
the fun, and the temperature of the air in the cabinet must be almost
constant.The following expression must then be satisfied to limit the
difference in temperature between the air in the cabinet and the outside air
to 10°C or less when the temperature in the cabinet rises:
   Internal heat loss P [W]� �
   6[W/m2� � °C] � �  surface area S[m2] � 10[°C] of rise in temperature
For example, a cabinet having a surface area of 4m2 has a cooling capacity
of 24W/°C.  To limit the internal temperature increase to 10°C under these
conditions, the internal heat must not  exceed 240W.  If the actual internal
heat is 320W, however, the temperature in the cabinet rises by 13°C or
more.  When this happens, the cooling capacity of the cabinet must be
improved using the heat exchanger described next.

If the temperature rise cannot be limited to 10°C by the cooling capacity
of the cabinet, a heat exchanger must be added. The heat exchanger
forcibly applies the air from both the inside and outside of the cabinet to
the cooling  fin to obtain effective cooling.  The heat exchanger enlarges
the surface area. Section 3.7 explains five heat exchangers supplied by
FANUC.  Select one of these according to the application.
If cooling fin A is used for the cabinet, the total cooling capacity of a
cabinet having a surface area of 4 m2 in the example above is improved
as follows :
   6W/m2� � °C � 4m2 + 9.1W/°C= 33.1W/°C
The calculated value verifies that even if the internal heat is 320 W, the
temperature rise can be limited to less than 10°C.
See Section 3.6 for installing the heat exchanger.

The cooling fin can be installed in two ways, as shown in Fig.3.6.1(b).
The following lists the general precautions to be observed when using the
cooling fins :

� The fans are not included with the cooling fin.  They should be
provided by the machine tool builder.

� Bring in the outside air from the bottom and exhaust the hot air from
the top.

� The inside air may flow from top to bottom or bottom to top.  However,
generally decide the direction as follows :
� Bring in the air near high heat loss components.
� Exhaust the air toward the most important components to be

cooled.
� For the cooling fin to display the specified cooling capacity, the air

inside the cooling fins must flow at a velocity of 2.5 m/sec or greater.

(velocity of air flow measurement)

Set the slit to the intake side and
measure the velocity at the slit.

� Generally, install the cooling fins to the door.  But be sure that the door
does not bend when installing the cooling fin.  The cooling fins are
equipped with packing.

Please install the heat exchanger by the following sequence:

1 Take out the external fan unit from the heat exchanger main unit. (Fig.
1)
Detach the external fan unit installation screws A (2 pieces), take out
the unit from the main unit by sliding it down, and detach the earth
cable and the power cable to the fan.  Also detach the installation screw
B (1 piece).

2 Install the heat exchanger main unit in the installation section which
has been panel cut. (Fig. 2)
When fastening down the heat exchanger main unit with the screws,
first, temporarily secure the panel and the heat exchanger main unit
with the installation screw B, which was taken out in 1).  After that,
secure the main unit by the installation screws.  In this case, the
external fan unit installation screw holes should be aligned with the
main unit screw holes.  (Please provide the installation screws for the
heat exchanger main unit.)
Because this product is composed of plastic, set the value shown
below for the screw tightening torque.

Heat exchanger main unit  (M4 screw) : 11 kgf.cm

External fan unit  (M3 screw) : 5 kgf.cm

3 Connect the power cable and the earth cable to the external fan unit (the
unit detached in 1), and secure the installation screw A to the main unit
from the outside.

The installation is now complete.

The CNC has been steadily reduced in size using surface–mount and
custom LSI technologies for electronic components. The CNC also is
designed to be protected from external noise.  However, it is difficult to
measure the level and frequency of noise quantitatively, and noise has
many uncertain factors. It is important to prevent both noise from being
generated and generated noise from being introduced into the CNC. This
precaution improves the stability of the CNC machine tool system.
The CNC component units are often installed close to the parts generating
noise in the power magnetics cabinet.  Possible noise sources into the
CNC are capacitive coupling, electromagnetic induction, and ground
loops.
When designing the power magnetics cabinet, guard against noise in the
machine as described in the following section.

The cables used for the CNC machine tool are classified as listed in the
following table:

The AC/DC solenoid and relay are used in the power magnetics cabinet.
A high pulse voltage is caused by coil inductance when these devices are
turned on or off.
This pulse voltage induced through the cable causes the electronic circuits
to be disturbed.

� Use a spark killer consisting of a resistor and capacitor in series.  This
type of spark killer is called a CR spark killer.(Use it under AC)
(A varistor is useful in clamping the peak voltage of the pulse voltage,
but cannot suppress the sudden rise of the pulse voltage.  FANUC
therefore recommends a CR spark killer.)

� The reference capacitance and resistance of the spark killer shall
conform to the following based on the current (I (A)) and DC
resistance of the stationary coil:

Part programs, offset data, and system parameters are stored in CMOS
memory in the control unit.

The program stored in the memory of the control unit is kept after power
is cut off.  Alcalic electric cells (single � 3 cells) are used for this
function.  The unit accommodating the dry cells is the battery unit.  The
cells must be periodically exchanged to new cells once a year at the user’s.
When exchanging the cells, the power must be always on.  (If the cells are
removed when the power is off, the parameters and programs stored in the
memory goes out.)

The NC is delivered to the machine tool  builder with the battery unit set
temporarily, so that it should be reset in the cabinet designed at the
machine tools builder.  Take notes on the following, and reset the battery
unit at the cabinet surface.  If the machine is delivered to the users with
the battery unit still temporarily set, the battery will not be able to be
exchanged at the user’s, resulting in a fatal maintenance problem.

1) The battery must be able to changed easily with the power on, at the
user’s side.

2) The battery unit must be away from coolant and chips.

When the voltage of the battery becomes low, alarm message “BAT”
blinks on the CRT display and the battery alarm signal is output to the
PMC.  When this alarm is displayed, replace the battery as soon as
possible.  In general, the battery can be replaced within one or two weeks,
however, this depends on the system configuration.
If the voltage of the battery becomes any lower, memory can no longer
be backed up.  Turning on the power to the control unit in this state causes
system alarm 910 (SRAM parity alarm) to occur because the contents of
memory are lost.  Clear the entire memory and reenter data after replacing
the battery.

The power to the control unit must be turned on when the battery is
replaced.  If the battery is disconnected when the power is turned off, the
contents of memory are lost.

Each control unit is factory–equipped with a battery so that the unit can
retain the factory–set parameters.  Never disconnect the battery while the
unit is turned off, therefore.  Mount the battery case containing the battery
on the cabinet, by means of the following procedure:

(1)Turn on the control unit.

(2)Leaving the control unit turned on, perform steps 1 to 5:

1 Remove the battery connector from the memory PC board.

2 Remove the battery case and cable from the yellow carton.
(Discard the carton.)

3 Remove the lid from the battery case, being careful to keep it
horizontal so that the screws do not full out.

4 Screw the battery case onto the cabinet at the predetermined
mounting position.  Replace the lid removed in step 3 and tighten
the screws.

5 Reconnect the connector removed in step 1.

The complete connection diagram shows examples of connecting all PC
boards that can fit into the slots of the master PC board.  Some slots can
accept two or more PC boards which are connected to different devices.
This drawing shows two or more identical slot names, but actual
individual slots on the master PC board have different names.  See the
connection of each slot according to the PC board to be fitted into the slot.

The diagram shows the connection of all PC boards that can be fitted into
the slots.  In the actual unit, the PC boards to be mounted are determined
by the model and optional functions.  Note that all the PC boards shown
in the diagram are not always mounted.

(1)Direct current input signal A

The direct current input signal A is the signals transmitted form the
machine tool to the CNC; the signals from the buttons, limit switches,
relay contracts, or the proximity switches.

(a) The contracts of the machine tools side must satisfy the following
conditions.

Capacity of the contracts:
30 VDC, 16mA or more

Leak current between contacts when circuit is open:
1 mA or less (26.4 V voltage)

Voltage fall between contacts when circuit is closed:
2 V or less (8.5 mA current) (including voltage fall of cables)

If the contact cannot obtain a sufficient voltage drop of less than 2V
between contacts when closed by such as a 2–line type adjacent
switch, if the delay time of the input signal stipulated in Fig.
6.2.1(b) is allowed to extend to a maximum of 30 ms, a voltage
drop of less than 3.5V between contacts when closed (current less
than 8.5 mA, 1 including voltage drop of cable) can also be used.
However, a unit in which operation is guaranteed at a current of 4
mA must be used.

A direct current output signal is used to drive a light emitting diode (LED)
indicator or a relay of a machine.  For the direct current output signal, a
non–insulation interface (direct current output signal A) and a DO
common output interface (direct current output signal B) are supported.
The non–insulation interface uses an NPN transistor as a driver, while the
DO common output interface uses a semiconductor contact.

(1)Direct current output signal A

(a) Rating of the output transistor

(i) Maximum load current when the output is on

Up to 200 mA, including an instantaneous value

(ii)Saturation voltage when the output is on

1.6 Vmax, 1.0 Vtyp at a load current of 200 mA

(iii)Withstand voltage when the output is off

Up to 24 V +20%, including an instantaneous value

NOTE
1 When connecting inductive loads like relays in the machine tool side, a spark killer must be

inserted.  The spark killer must also be inserted as near as possible (within 20 cm) to the load.
When connecting capacitance load in the machine tool side, a resistance for current limit must
be inserted in series, and it must be used within the rated current and voltage, including
instantaneous current and voltage.

2 When lighting a lamp directly with a solid state relay output, a rush current may flow to damage
the driver.  A protection circuit as below must be inserted and it must be used within the rated
voltage and current, including instantaneous current and voltage.ww

This sample circuit uses I/O cards E2, and E3 as a source DO.  The voltage of the regulated power
supply can be adjusted from 24 to 48 VDC.  The polarity of the regulated power supply is inverted
when the I/O card is used as a sink DO.  In this case, the orientation of the LED and surge suppres-
sion diode must be inverted.

When a PMC is used, a signal input from the machine is input to the PMC,
which outputs a signal to the CNC according to the input signal and
sequence program.  A signal output from the CNC is sent through the
PMC to the machine.

The pins of the internal I/O card can be more flexibly assigned to I/O
signals than those of a system without a PMC.  The CNC, however,
monitors some signals directly, that is, not through the PMC.

The display unit of the CNC is used to display information such as CNC
programs and parameters to the operator and to assist the operator in the
operation of the machine.

For the Series 0–D, CRT display unit is available.  This section describes
how to connect these display units to the control unit.  Outline drawings
are given in the appendix.

Each display unit can be provided as a unit incorporating an MDI
keyboard, for example a CRT/MDI unit.  The MDI section can be
connected in the same way as a separate MDI unit.  For an explanation of
making this connection, see the subsequent chapter.

Some display units are available either as a standard type or as a type
conforming to European safety standards (qualifying for CE marking).
Since the type qualifying for CE marking uses a different power supply
unit, the connection of the CE marking type differs from that of the
standard type in some respects.  The unit qualifying for CE marking with
the MDI keyboard has keys of different colors, and may use symbolic
keys.

The unit of CRT/MDI has a stud or hole for grounding.  Ground the unit
to a housing in the vicinity, using a line containing conductors of 2 mm2

or greater.

transmission ends.

CS 106 Input Sending
permitted

When both this signal and the DR sig-
nal are set, the NC can send data.
If external device processing is delayed
by a punching operation, etc., NC data
sending can be stopped by turning off
this signal after sending two characters,
including the data being sent currently.
If this signal will not be used, make
sure to strap this signal circuit to the RS
signal circuit.

DR 107 Input Data set
ready

When external device is ready to oper-
ate, this signal is set.  This signal
should usually be connected to the sig-
nal indicating external device power
supply being on. (ER signal of external
device). See Note below.
The NC transfers data when this signal
is set.  If the signals turned off during
data transfer, alarm 086 is issued. If the
DR signal will not be used, make sure
to strap this signal circuit to the ER sig-
nal circuit.

ER 108.2 Output NC ready

Generally, two transmission methods are available at the serial interface.
Series 0 use the start–stop method.  With this method, start and stop
signals are output before and after each data bit.

One character in start–stop

B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8

Start bit Data bit
(8 bit including one parity bit)

Stop bits
(2 bits)

Transmission codes are as follows:

(i) EIA code and Control codes DC1 to DC4.

(ii) ISO code and Control codes DC1 to DC4 (Optional ISO code input
is necessary.)

The connected external device must be able to recognize the following
control codes, sent from NC.

Control code 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

DC1 Tape reader start � � �

DC2 Tape punch designation � � �

DC3 Tape reader stop � � � � �

DC4 Tape punch release � � �

NOTE
The listed control codes are used for both EIA and ISO.

In this interface, control codes DC to DC4 are used.

(a) NC can control external device by issuing codes DC1 to DC4.

(b)When external processing falls behind the pace of the NC signals
(When NC issues data)

(i) External device can temporarily stop NC data output by using the
NC’s CS signal.  Data output stops within two characters including
a currently transmitting character when CS OFF signal is input to
NC.  When CS signal is turned on again, data transmission start.

(ii) If control code DC3 is input to NC, NC stops data output within
ten characters.  When control code DC1 is input to NC, NC starts
sending data again.

(c) When the external device is equipped with an ISO/EIA converter, the
external device must satisfy the specification shown in Table 7.3.3 (a).

The power supply to the manual pulse generator is 5 VDC, same as for
the pulse coder.  It is therefore necessary to prevent cable resistance from
causing the supply voltage to drop more than 0.2V (total for both the 0
V and 5 V lines).
This is written as:

0.2� 0.1� R� 2Lm

0.1 : 0.1 A power supply current of the manual pulse generator
R : Resistance per unit length of the wire (Ω/m)
m : Number of wires connected in each 0 V and 5 V line
L : Wire length (m)

This can be converted to the following equation:

CAUTION
To protect the signals from external noise, assign the cable’s
central pairs to each pair of current feedback signal and
ground signal (i.e., IRn and GDRn, and ISn and GDSn).
Otherwise, external noise may result in uneven feed or
abnormal sound.

For connection on control motor amplifier α series or β series, refer to the

RECOMMENDED CABLE SPECIFICATION
A02B–0120–K800(5m)

NOTE
1 The total length of the cable between the CNC and amplifier

and that between the amplifier and motor shall not exceed
50m.

2 As the current feedback lines (IRn and ISn), use the middle
twisted pair of the recommended cable.  If any other pair is
used, abnormal noise or oscillation may occur.

3 Use a servo unit which supports the type–B interface.  When
using a servo unit which supports both the type–A and
type–B interfaces, select the type–B interface.  For details,
refer to the manual supplied with the servo unit.  If the
interface setting is incorrect, a servo alarm (AL401 V
READY OFF) will be issued.ww

The connector to which the feedback cable from the built–in pulse coder
is connected varies with the servo interface type.

For the type A interface, connect the feedback cable to the feedback
connector on the axis control card (for example, M185 for the first axis).

For the type B interface, connect the feedback cable to the feedback
connector on the servo amplifier (for example, JF1 for the first axis).

The user can select any of the supported axes as the axes to be controlled.
A cable for a servo amplifier or motor need not be connected to those axes
that are not to be used.  Leaving the connector for an unused axis open,
however, causes the CNC to enter a servo alarm state.  This section
describes how to handle (clamp) unused axes.

NOTE
Servo parameters must also be set for clamped axes.  Set
the same servo parameters as those for any axis to be used.

Connect a command clamping dummy connector to the command
connector of each unused axis.

C. HALF PITCH 20–PIN INTERFACE

 CONNECTORS AND CABLES

185

This connector assembles multiple #28AWG wires into a single
connection.  In comparison with solder contact and crimp contact
connectors, this connector enables a cable to be assembled at a much
lower cost.

The Honda Tsushin PCR–E20FS is a solder contact type connector used
for assembling a small number of cables or for cable assembly on site.
The Hirose Electric FI40–20S is equivalent to the PCR–E20FS but has
large solder terminals to facilitate soldering.

Hirose Electric has also developed the FI40A–20S, which has the same
number of pins as the FI40–20S but a larger solder row pitch to enable
easier soldering.  Since the applicable cable diameter of the case has been
increased, the FI40A–20S can also be used with thick wires (diameter:
9.2 mm).

These connectors enable the soldering of wires of up to around #20AWG.
When a large number of #20AWG wires are used, however, the pitch of
the solder contacts may be too small to achieve satisfactory workability.
To overcome this problem, the Hirose Electric FI40–2015S has been
developed.  The number of pins has been reduced so that the pitch of the
solder contacts is as large as a conventional MR connector.

NOTE
The connectors can also be used for pulse coders and other
equipment.  In this case, the supported cable outside
diameters are 9.2 mm and 6.0 mm, respectively.  Either
connector can be used, depending on the outside diameter
of the cable to be used.
The FANUC–developed cable (A66L–0001–0286) has an
outside diameter of 8.5 mm and cannot be used with these
connectors.

Cable wires generally need to be developed or ordered by the machine tool
builder.
FANUC has developed wires that specifically suit the interface connector
of the Series 0/00/0–Mate.  They are listed in the table below, for your
convenience when ordering  from the manufacturer.
(In addition to these, a cable for moving parts is under development.)

NOTE
For the pulse coder, scale, and manual pulse generator,
each of which has a +5–V power supply, wires need to be
selected taking into consideration the supply voltage drop
caused by the resistance of the cable.
A66L–0001–0286 has been designed for use with a cable
length of 20 mm or less.  If the cable length exceeds 20 m,
relay a cable with a lower resistance, such as
A66L–0001–0157.
The number of manual pulse generators to be connected is
assumed to be three.  If only one generator is connected,
the cable can be extended to a maximum of 50 m by
connecting wires with in parallel a cross–sectional area of
0.5 mm2 for the power supply.

B–62543EN/02 D. EMERGENCY STOP SIGNAL

189

D EMERGENCY STOP SIGNAL
Using the emergency stop signal effectively enables the design of safe
machine tools.
The emergency stop signal is provided to bring a machine tool to an
emergency stop.  It is input to the CNC controller, servo amplifier, and
spindle amplifier.  An emergency stop signal is usually generated by
closing the B contact of a pushbutton switch.
When the emergency stop signal (*ESP) contact is closed, the CNC
controller enters the emergency stop released state, such that the servo and
spindle motors can be controlled and operated.
When the emergency stop signal (*ESP) contact opens, the CNC
controller is reset and enters the emergency stop state, and the servo and
spindle motors are decelerated to a stop.
Shutting off the servo amplifier power causes a dynamic brake to be
applied to the servo motor.  Even when a dynamic brake is applied,
however, a servo motor attached to a vertical axis can move under the
force of gravity.  To overcome this problem, use a servo motor with a
brake.
While the spindle motor is running, shutting off the motor–driving power
to the spindle amplifier allows the spindle motor to continue running
under its own inertia, which is quite dangerous.  When the emergency stop
signal (*ESP) contact opens, it is necessary to confirm that the spindle
motor has been decelerated to a stop, before the spindle motor power is
shut off.
The FANUC control amplifier α series products are designed to satisfy
the above requirements.  The emergency stop signal should be input to the
power supply module (called the PSM).  The PSM outputs a motor power
MCC control signal, which can be used to switch the power applied to the
power supply module on and off.
The CNC controller is designed to detect overtravel by using a software
limit function.  Normally, no hardware limit switch is required to detect
overtravel.  If the machine goes beyond a software limit because of a servo
feedback failure, however, it is necessary to provide a stroke end limit
switch, connected so that the emergency stop signal can be used to stop
the machine.
Fig. 10 shows an example showing how to use the emergency stop signal
with this CNC controller and α series control amplifier.

WARNING
To use a spindle motor and amplifier produced by a manufacturer other than FANUC, refer to
the corresponding documentation as well as this manual.  Design the emergency stop
sequence such that, if the emergency stop signal contact opens while the spindle motor is
rotating, the spindle motor is decelerated until it stops.
