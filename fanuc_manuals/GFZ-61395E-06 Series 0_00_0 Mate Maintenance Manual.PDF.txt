2 WARNINGS, CAUTIONS, AND NOTES RELATED TOCHECK OPERATION
WARNING

1. When checking the operation of the machine with the cover removed

(1) The user’s clothing could become caught in the spindle or other components, thus
presenting a danger of injury.  When checking the operation, stand away from the machine
to ensure that your clothing does not become tangled in the spindle or other components.

(2) When checking the operation, perform idle operation without workpiece.  When a
workpiece is mounted in the machine, a malfunction could cause the workpiece to be
dropped or destroy the tool tip, possibly scattering fragments throughout the area.  This
presents a serious danger of injury.  Therefore, stand in a safe location when checking the
operation.

2. When checking the machine operation with the power magnetics cabinet door opened

(1) The power magnetics cabinet has a high–voltage section (carrying a  mark).  Never
touch the high–voltage section.  The high–voltage section presents a severe risk of electric
shock.  Before starting any check of the operation, confirm that the cover is mounted on
the high–voltage section.  When the high–voltage section itself must be checked, note that
touching a terminal presents a severe danger of electric shock.

(2) Within the power magnetics cabinet, internal units present potentially injurious corners and
projections.  Be careful when working inside the power magnetics cabinet.

3. Never attempt to machine a workpiece without first checking the operation of the machine.
Before starting a production run, ensure that the machine is operating correctly by performing
a trial run using, for example, the single block, feedrate override, or machine lock function or
by operating the machine with neither a tool nor workpiece mounted.  Failure to confirm the
correct operation of the machine may result in the machine behaving unexpectedly, possibly
causing damage to the workpiece and/or machine itself, or injury to the user.

4. Before operating the machine, thoroughly check the entered data.
Operating the machine with incorrectly specified data may result in the machine behaving
unexpectedly, possibly causing damage to the workpiece and/or machine itself, or injury to the
user.

5. Ensure that the specified feedrate is appropriate for the intended operation.  Generally, for each
machine, there is a maximum allowable feedrate.  The appropriate feedrate varies with the
intended operation.  Refer to the manual provided with the machine to determine the maximum
allowable feedrate.  If a machine is run at other than the correct speed, it may behave
unexpectedly, possibly causing damage to the workpiece and/or machine itself, or injury to the
user.

6. When using a tool compensation function, thoroughly check the direction and amount of
compensation.  Operating the machine with incorrectly specified data may result in the machine
behaving unexpectedly, possibly causing damage to the workpiece and/or machine itself, or
injury to the user.

3 WARNINGS AND NOTES RELATED TO REPLACEMENT
WARNING

1. Always turn off the power to the CNC and the main power to the power magnetics cabinet.  If
only the power to the CNC is turned off, power may continue to be supplied to the serve section.
In such a case, replacing a unit may damage the unit, while also presenting a danger of electric
shock.

2. When a heavy unit is to be replaced, the task must be undertaken by two persons.  If the
replacement is attempted  by only one person, the replacement unit could slip and fall, possibly
causing injury.

3. After the power is turned off, the servo amplifier and spindle amplifier may retain voltages for
a while, such that there is a danger of electric shock even while the amplifier is turned off.  Allow
at least twenty minutes after turning off the power for these residual voltages to dissipate.

4. When replacing a unit, ensure that the new unit has the same parameter and other settings as the
old unit.  (For details, refer to the manual provided with the machine.)  Otherwise, unpredictable
machine movement could damage the workpiece or the machine itself, and present a danger of
injury.

4 WARNINGS AND NOTES RELATED TO PARAMETERS
WARNING

1. When machining a workpiece for the first time after modifying a parameter, close the machine
cover.  Never use the automatic operation function immediately after such a modification.
Instead, confirm normal machine operation by using functions such as the single block function,
feedrate override function, and machine lock function, or by operating the machine without
mounting a tool and workpiece.  If the machine is used before confirming that it operates
normally, the machine may move unpredictably, possibly damaging the machine or workpiece,
and presenting a risk of injury.

2. The CNC and PMC parameters are set to their optimal values, so that those parameters usually
need not be modified.  When a parameter must be modified for some reason, ensure that you
fully understand the function of that parameter before attempting to modify it.  If a parameter
is set incorrectly, the machine may move unpredictably, possibly damaging the machine or
workpiece, and presenting a risk of injury.

5 WARNINGS RELATED TO DAILY MAINTENANCE
WARNING

1. Memory backup battery replacement

When replacing the memory backup batteries, keep the power to the machine (CNC) turned on,
and apply an emergency stop to the machine.  Because this work is performed with the power
on and the cabinet open, only those personnel who have received approved safety and
maintenance training may perform this work.
When replacing the batteries, be careful not to touch the high–voltage circuits (marked  and
fitted with an insulating cover).
Touching the uncovered high–voltage circuits presents an extremely dangerous electric shock
hazard.

NOTE

The CNC uses batteries to preserve the contents of its memory, because it must retain data such as
programs, offsets, and parameters even while external power is not applied.
If the battery voltage drops, a low battery voltage alarm is displayed on the machine operator’s panel
or CRT screen.
When a low battery voltage alarm is displayed, replace the batteries within a week.  Otherwise, the
contents of the CNC’s memory will be lost.
To replace the battery, see the procedure described in Section 2.6 of this manual.

WARNING

2. Absolute pulse coder battery replacement

When replacing the memory backup batteries, keep the power to the machine (CNC) turned on,
and apply an emergency stop to the machine.  Because this work is performed with the power
on and the cabinet open, only those personnel who have received approved safety and
maintenance training may perform this work.
When replacing the batteries, be careful not to touch the high–voltage circuits (marked  and
fitted with an insulating cover).
Touching the uncovered high–voltage circuits presents an extremely dangerous electric shock
hazard.

NOTE

The absolute pulse coder uses batteries to preserve its absolute position.
If the battery voltage drops, a low battery voltage alarm is displayed on the machine operator’s panel
or CRT screen.
When a low battery voltage alarm is displayed, replace the batteries within a week.  Otherwise, the
absolute position data held by the pulse coder will be lost.
To replace the battery, see the procedure described in Section 2.6 of this manual.

Similarly to the pulse coder, the manual pulse generator is designed to
operate on 5 VDC.  So, any voltage drop relative to the supply voltage
must be kept to within 0.2 V (total drop through the 0 V and 5 V lines).
Namely:

0.2� 0.1� R� 2Lm
where 0.1 : Current required by the manual pulse generator

R : Wire resistance per unit length [Ω/m]
m : Number of wires in the 0 V or 5 V cable
L : Cable length [m]

Thus,
L � m

� The SIN, *SIN and SOUT, *SOUT signals must be connected
by twisted pair cable.

� Recommended cable: A66L–0001–0284#10P (single shield
twisted pair)

� The cable shield should be clamped with a cable clamp to the
cabinet earth plate on the JD1A side.

� Maximum cable length: 10m

In cases where the FANUC I/O Link slave power supply selected is
neither the 24VDC supply used with the Series 0 nor the 200VAC Series
0 power supply input unit, then it is essential that the power be switched
on to all slave units before it is switched on to the Series 0.  In other words
the Series 0, which is in this case the master, must come last.

If the power supply to any one of the slave units connected by the FANUC
I/O Link is cut off then all units connected by the I/O Link, including the
Series 0 itself, will assume abnormal status.  To restore normal operating
status all the units must be switched off and then started up again one by
one in the appropriate order.

This section describes the servo interface between the Series 0 and the
digital control AC servo amplifier and servo motor.

The Series 0 supports three types of axis control cards according to the
type of the pulse coder built into the servo motor or type of the servo
interface.

For an explanation of each servo amplifier unit and servo motor, refer to
the relevant manual.

� Axis control card for A/B–phase pulse coders (Type A interface)

� Axis control card for serial pulse coders (Type A interface)

� Axis control card for type B interface

Axis control cards for serial pulse coders can also be connected to an
A/B–phase pulse coder.

NOTE
In a closed loop system using a separate pulse coder, the
axis control cards for the A/B–phase pulse coders and those
for serial pulse coders use different connectors for their
feedback cables.

When an axis control card for a type B interface is used, the JFn connector
on the servo amplifier side is used as the feedback or velocity feedback
connector.  n varies with the servo amplifier being used.  A type B

feedback signal and ground signal (i.e., IRn and GDRn, and ISn and GDSn).  Otherwise,
external noise may result in uneven feed or abnormal sound.

For a C series servo amplifier, connect the cable to M34 or M184.
For an α series servo amplifier, connect the cable to M184.  It cannot be connected to M34.

NOTE
To protect the signals from external noise, assign the cable’s central pairs to each pair of current
feedback signal and ground signal (i.e., IRn and GDRn, and ISn and GDSn).  Otherwise,
external noise may result in uneven feed or abnormal sound.

NOTE
1 The total length of the cable between the CNC and amplifier

and that between the amplifier and motor shall not exceed
50m.

2 As the current feedback lines (IRn and ISn), use the middle
twisted pair of the recommended cable.  If any other pair is
used, abnormal noise or oscillation may occur.

3 Use a servo unit which supports the type–B interface.  When
using a servo unit which supports both the type–A and
type–B interfaces, select the type–B interface.  For details,
refer to the manual supplied with the servo unit.  If the
interface setting is incorrect, a servo alarm (AL401 V
READY OFF) will be issued.

The user can select any of the supported axes as the axes to be controlled.
A cable for a servo amplifier or motor need not be connected to those axes
that are not to be used.  Leaving the connector for an unused axis open,
however, causes the CNC to enter a servo alarm state.  This section
describes how to handle (clamp) unused axes.

NOTE
Servo parameters must also be set for clamped axes.  Set
the same servo parameters as those for any axis to be used.

Connect a command clamping dummy connector to the command
connector of each unused axis (for example, M34 or M184 for the first
axis).

Some remote buffer cards can also be used for the FANUC DNC2
interface.  FANUC DNC2 is a communication protocol which enables the
exchange of a wide range of data between the CNC and a personal
computer which is connected to the CNC via the RS–232C interface.  Its
hardware connection is the same as that for the remote buffer.  For its
specifications and other information, refer to the FANUC DNC2

NOTE
1 Be sure to use twisted pair cable.
2 Note that unlike other signals, the *DM signal on the

CNC–side connector is not regularly positioned.  This is
intended to maintain a low probability of breakdown due to
inadvertent connection with a wrong connector.

3 The connection of TT, *TT, RT, and *RT is required only
when an external clock is used.

4 When using an external clock, connect the cable to the M73
connector.  Either the M73 or M77 connector can be used
if an external clock is not used.

5 The M77 connector is also used for the RS–232C interface.
Those pins for which nothing is indicated in the connector

The peripheral units, such as the control unit and CRT/MDI, have been
designed on the assumption that they are housed in closed cabinets.  In
this manual “cabinet” refers to the following:

� Cabinet manufactured by the machine tool builder for housing the
control unit or peripheral units;

� Cabinet for housing the flexible turnkey system provided by FANUC;

� Operation pendant, manufactured by the machine tool builder, for
housing the CRT/MDI unit or operator’s panel.

� Equivalent to the above.

The environmental conditions when installing these cabinets shall
conform to the following table.

Room temperat re

The power capacity of the CNC control unit, which in this section means
the specification required for the power supply, is obtained by adding the
power capacity of the control section and the power capacity of the servo
section.
The power capacity of the control section includes the power capacity of
the control unit, CRT/MDI, I/O unit, and operator’s panel interface.

Power capacity of the
control section

0.4 kVA

Power capacity of the
servo section

Depends on servo motor type.
Refer to each DESCRIPTIONS.

The CNC has been steadily reduced in size using surface–mount and
custom LSI technologies for electronic components. The CNC also is
designed to be protected from external noise.  However, it is difficult to
measure the level and frequency of noise quantitatively, and noise has
many uncertain factors.  Generally, noise is induced in the CNC due to
electrostatic coupling, electromagnetic induction, and ground loop.
The CNC is equipped with provisions to minimize the influence of
extraneous noise.  However, it is difficult to quantitatively measure the
strength of the noise and how often it occurs.  Besides, noise has many
unknown elements.  To maintain the stability of the CNC machine tool
system, it is important to minimize the occurrence of noise and prevent
it from being induced into the CNC.
When designing the power magnetics cabinet, guard against noise in the
machine as described in the following section.

The following ground systems are provided for the CNC machine tool:

� Signal ground system (SG)
The signal ground (SG) supplies the reference voltage (0V) of the
electrical signal system.

� Frame ground system (FG)
The frame ground system (FG) is used for safety, and suppressing
external and internal noises.  In the frame ground system, the
frames, cases of the units, panels, and shields for the interface
cables between the units are connected.

� The grounding resistance of the system ground shall be 100 ohms
or less (class 3 grounding).

� The system ground cable must have enough cross–sectional area
to safely carry the accidental current flow into the system ground
when an accident such as a short circuit occurs.
(Generally, it must have the cross–sectional area of the AC power
cable or more.)

� Use the cable containing the AC power wire and the system
ground wire so that power is supplied with the ground wire
connected.

The AC/DC solenoid and relay are used in the power magnetics cabinet.
A high pulse voltage is caused by coil inductance when these devices are
turned on or off.
This pulse voltage induced through the cable causes the electronic circuits
to be disturbed.

� Use a spark killer consisting of a resistor and capacitor in series.  This
type of spark killer is called a CR spark killer.(Use it under AC)
(A varistor is useful in clamping the peak voltage of the pulse
voltage, but cannot suppress the sudden rise of the pulse voltage.
FANUC therefore recommends a CR spark killer.)

� The reference capacitance and resistance of the spark killer shall
conform to the following based on the current (I (A)) and DC
resistance of the stationary coil:

1) Resistance (R) : Equivalent DC resistance of the coil

2) Capacitance (C) :

The CNC cables that require shielding should be clamped by the method
shown below.  This cable clamp treatment is for both cable support and
proper grounding of the shield.  To insure stable CNC system operation,
follow this cable clamp method.
Partially peel out the sheath and expose the shield.  Push and clamp by
the plate metal fittings for clamp at the part.  The ground plate must be

Part programs, offset data, and system parameters are stored in the CMOS
memory of the control unit.  Three ”D”(R20) size alkaline batteries are
used to back up the memory of the control unit when the AC power source
is off.  These batteries are held in the battery unit.  The user is requested
to replace these batteries once a year.  When replacing the batteries, it is
necessary to keep the power supply switched on.  Note that if the batteries
are removed when the power supply is off, the contents (parameters and
programs) of memory will be lost.

If the battery voltage drops, the warning message ”BAT” appears on the
CRT screen, and a battery alarm signal is sent to the PMC.  If a battery
alarm occurs, replace the batteries as soon as possible (no later than within
one or two weeks).  Actually, however, the battery life depends on the
configuration of your system.

If the battery voltage drops even further, it will become impossible to provide
memory backup.  If the power is switched on under this condition, a system
alarm (SRAM party alarm) occurs, because the contents of memory will
have been damaged.  Therefore, after replacing the batteries, it is necessary
to clear the entire contents of memory and re–enter the necessary programs
and data.  Keep the power switched on when replacing the batteries.  Do not
forget that disconnecting the memory backup batteries with the power
switched off will result in the total loss of the memory contents.

Battery replacement method

1 Obtain three new ”D” (R20) size alkaline dry cells.

2 Switch on the power to the control unit.

3 Remove the battery case lid.

4 Replace the batteries, observing the correct orientation.

5 Replace the battery case lid.

6 Switch off the power to the control unit.

(1) Obtain four new ”D”(R20) size alkaline dry cells.

(2) Switch on the power to the CNC.
Note that replacing the batteries with the CNC power switched off
will result in the machine absolute position being lost, making it
necessary to make a return to the reference position.

(3) Loosen the battery case screws, then remove the lid.
To determine the location of the battery case, refer to the manual
published by the machine tool builder.

(4) Install the new batteries.
The batteries must be installed as shown below.  Note the orientation.

(3) Adjustments and settings

This power supply unit requires no adjustment or setting.  Do not
attempt to adjust the reference voltage (=10.00V) at A10 unless
absolutely necessary, because the reference voltage has been adjusted
during unit test; merely confirm the voltage across A10 and A0 of
check connector CP16.
If the reference voltage at A10 falls outside the rated range, set it to
10.00V, using VR11, while measuring the voltage with a digital
voltmeter.  Rotating VR11 clockwise increases the voltage at A10.
After the power supply unit is replaced, always to check the reference
voltage at A10.

(4) Causes of blown fuses and required corrective actions

This power supply unit is provided with fuses F11 and F12 at its input,
fuse F13 at the +24V output, and fuse F14 at the +24E output.
Possible causes of these fuses blowing are listed below together with
the corrective actions required to restore normal operation.

1. Fuses F11 and F12

(a) Short circuit in surge absorber VS11
VS11 is intended to suppress surge voltages on the input line.
If an excessively large surge voltage or steady voltage is
applied to VS11, it breaks down, short–circuiting and,
causing F11 and F12 to blow.  If VS11 has short–circuited,
but you do not have a replacement part on hand, the machine
can be used with VS11 removed.  In such a case, however,
you should obtain a replacement and install it as soon as
possible, especially when the machine is being used in an
installation prone to surge voltages.  The specification
number of VS11 is A50L–8001–0067#431U.

(b) Short circuit in diode stack DS11

(c) Short circuit between the collector and emitter of switching
transistors Q14 and Q15



2. HARDWARE B–61395E/06

116

(d) Short circuit in diodes D33 and D34

(e) Short circuit between the collector and emitter of transistor
Q1 in the auxiliary power supply circuit

If you suspect that any of short circuits (b) to (e) has  occurred in
the respective parts, replace the power supply unit with a spare.
When replacing a fuse, use a replacement having the same rating.
The specification number for fuses F11 and 12 is
A60L–0001–0194#5.0.

2. Fuse F13
(a) A short circuit may have occurred in the CRT/MDI unit or a

+24 V power supply cord leading to it.  Remove the cord from
CP15, and check the unit and cord carefully.

(b) A short circuit may have occurred in the +24 V circuit on the
master printed–circuit board.  Remove the cable from CP14
and CP15.  Also, remove the power supply unit from the
master printed–circuit board, then check the printed–circuit
board carefully.  When replacing a fuse, use a replacement
having the same rating.  The specification number for fuse
F13 is A60L–0001–0075#3.2.

3. Fuse F14
(a) Short circuit in +24E power supply cables for various

printed–circuit board units

(b) Ground fault of the +24E power supply line in the machine
or false contact of the +24E power supply line with another
power supply line

If either of (a) or (b) may have occurred, remove the cable from
CP14, and check it carefully.  When replacing a fuse, use a
replacement part having the same rating.  The specification
number for fuse F14 is A60L–0001–0046#5.0.

It is easy to mount and dismount the CNC power supply unit, because it
is designed to be mounted on, and connected directly to, the master
printed–circuit board.  All its AC inputs and DC outputs are linked via
connectors.

Because this power supply unit has a built–in input unit function, it is not
necessary to prepare a separate relay or input unit for switching the AC
input on and off.  The AC input can be connected directly to the power
supply unit.  The unit has an AC service outlet, which is switched on and
off simultaneously with the power supply unit.  This AC service outlet can
be used to supply power to a unit such as a fan motor.

(3) Adjustments and settings

This power supply unit requires no adjustment or setting.  Do not
attempt to adjust the reference voltage (=10.00V) at A10 unless
absolutely necessary, because the reference voltage has been adjusted
during unit test; merely confirm the voltage across A10 and A0 of
check connector CP16.
If the reference voltage at A10 falls outside the rated range, set it to
10.00V, using VR11, while measuring the voltage with a digital
voltmeter.  Rotating VR11 clockwise increases the voltage at A10.
After the power supply unit is replaced, always to check the reference
voltage at A10.

(4) Causes of blown fuses and required corrective actions

This power supply unit is provided with fuses F11 and F12 at its input,
fuse F13 at the +24V output, and fuse F14 at the +24E output.
Possible causes of these fuses blowing are listed below together with
the corrective actions required to restore normal operation.

1. Fuses F11 and F12

(a) Short circuit in surge absorber VS11
VS11 is intended to suppress surge voltages on the input line.
If an excessively large surge voltage or steady voltage is
applied to VS11, it breaks down, short–circuiting and,
causing F11 and F12 to blow.  If VS11 has short–circuited,
but you do not have a replacement part on hand, the machine
can be used with VS11 removed.  In such a case, however,
you should obtain a replacement and install it as soon as
possible, especially when the machine is being used in an
installation prone to surge voltages.  The specification
number of VS11 is A50L–8001–0067#431U.

(b) Short circuit in diode stack DS11

(c) Short circuit between the collector and emitter of switching
transistors Q14 and Q15

(d) Short circuit in diodes D33 and D34

(e) Short circuit between the collector and emitter of transistor
Q1 in the auxiliary power supply circuit

If you suspect that any of short circuits (b) to (e) has  occurred in
the respective parts, replace the power supply unit with a spare.
When replacing a fuse, use a replacement having the same rating.
The specification number for fuses F11 and 12 is
A60L–0001–0245#GP75.

2. Fuse F13
(a) A short circuit may have occurred in the CRT/MDI unit or a

+24 V power supply cord leading to it.  Remove the cord from
CP15, and check the unit and cord carefully.

(b) A short circuit may have occurred in the +24 V circuit on the
master printed–circuit board.  Remove the cable from CP14
and CP15.  Also, remove the power supply unit from the
master printed–circuit board, then check the printed–circuit
board carefully.  When replacing a fuse, use a replacement
having the same rating.  The specification number for fuse
F13 is A60L–0001–0075#3.2.

3. Fuse F14
(a) Short circuit in +24E power supply cables for various

printed–circuit board units

(b) Ground fault of the +24E power supply line in the machine
or false contact of the +24E power supply line with another
power supply line

If either of (a) or (b) may have occurred, remove the cable from
CP14, and check it carefully.  When replacing a fuse, use a
replacement part having the same rating.  The specification
number for fuse F14 is A60L–0001–0046#5.0.



2. HARDWARE B–61395E/06

128

4. Fuse F1
Fuse F1 and surge absorber VS1 are wired so that, if a high current
flows through VS1, it may cause F1 to blow.  This is intended to
protect the circuits in the power supply unit from an abnormal
voltage that may occur due to a failure in the auxiliary power
supply circuit of the power supply unit and an abnormal voltage
that may originate in the power supply ON/OFF switch contact
signal line or external alarm signal line.  If F1 blows, probable
causes are:

(1) Failure in the auxiliary power supply circuit (M1, Q1, T1,
D1, Q2, or ZD1)

(2) False contact between the power supply ON/OFF switch
contact signal line or external alarm signal line and the AC
power line

If cause (1) is more likely, replace the power supply unit. If cause (2) is
more likely, replace the power supply unit, because the power supply
unit may have failed.  After the power supply ON/OFF switch contact
signal line and external alarm signal line have been checked, and all
abnormal conditions (if any) have been cleared, if replacing F1 restores
normal operation, there is no need to replace the power supply unit.  The
specification number of fuse F1 is A60L–0001–0172#DM03.  When
replacing the fuse, use a replacement having the same rating.

It is easy to mount and dismount the CNC power supply unit, because it
is designed to be mounted on, and connected directly to, the master
printed–circuit board.  All its AC inputs and DC outputs are linked via
connectors.

Because this power supply unit has a built–in input unit function, it is not
necessary to prepare a separate relay or input unit for switching the AC
input on and off.  The AC input can be connected directly to the power
supply unit.  The unit has an AC service outlet, which is switched on and
off simultaneously with the power supply unit.  This AC service outlet can
be used to supply power to a unit such as a fan motor.

It is necessary to regulary clean the heat transformer, because the heat
transformation ability will be reduced by the accumulation of dust.  The
frequency of the cleaning needed differs according to the installation
environment and therefore should be determined by your own judgment
according to the degree of dirt.

Air filter cleaning and replacement method

1 When cleaning and replacing the filter, be sure to cut off the fan’s
electric power source.

2 Detach the filter cover and take out the filter inside.

Detach the cover by pressing, the flanges
which are in the grooves of both sides 
towards the inside by minus screwdriver, etc.

3 Protect the filter from silting due to dust by blowing air on both sides.

4 When dirt is conspicuous, press wash with a neutral detergent, rinse
with fresh water, and the washing, allow to dry naturally.  When
replacing with the same product.

5 Insert the filter in the cover, align the flange in the groove, and install
by pressing.  Confirm that the cover will not come loose even if it is

This chapter describes the signals between the machine operator’s panel,
magnetics cabinet and the PMC, connection of the signals between PMC
and CNC, and confirmation method of on/off state of these signals.
It also describes system configuration of PMC, parameters of PMC,
ladder and how to display time chart of the signals on the CRT.
It also describes a method of inputting/outputting PMC parameters to an
external device.

• The search function searches a signal in the forward direction and
displays the ladder with the searched signal at its head. Because there
may exist plural contacts, repeat the search operation to find plural
locations, repeat the search operation to find plural locations with the
specified signal.

• If a specified signal is not found up to the end of the program (ladder),
execution returns to the head of a program and search continues.

When plural reference marks are on a linear scale, a quotient of the
distance between the reference marks divided by an interfer may be
used as a reference counter capacity:

MTB.
When the absolute position detector is used, the reference position once
set remains also during power off.  When the absolute detector is replaced
or absolute position is lost, perform this setting.

Check the LED on the input unit or power supply unit AI.

(1) If no power supply alarm is detected (the red ”ALM” LED does not
light):

1. If the PIL LED is off:

(a) Check the input fuse of the input unit or power supply unit
AI. Measure the voltage across the R and S terminals on the
screw–on terminal strip of the input unit or at the connector
CP1 of the power supply unit AI using a
volt–ohm–milliammeter, and check whether 200 VAC is
available. If the 200 VAC cannot be detected at connector
CP1, check the corresponding circuit in the machine.

(b) If both the fuse and power supply voltage are normal, the
printed–circuit board of the input unit or the power supply
unit AI may be defective.

2. If the PIL LED lights, and the input voltage is normal:
Check whether the conditions for switching the power on are
satisfied.

When power is turned on with the connector CP11 at the bottom of the
power supply unit detached, if a voltage of 200 VAC appears across pins
1 and 2 for about one second, it means that an ON condition is satisfied.
(This method is not applicable to the power supply unit AI.)

(2) If a power supply alarm is detected (the red ”ALM” LED lights):

The most likely causes are a failure (short circuit or ground fault) or a
defective power supply unit.  Use the check procedure described below.

NOTE
Do NOT detach the memory backup battery cable.

1. Switch the power off, then check for a short circuit or ground fault
between the DC voltage check terminals (+5V, +15V, –15V,
+24V, and +24E) and the 0V point.
(Overcurrent)
If a short circuit or ground fault is detected, locate its cause by
unhooking the related connectors, one by one, and measuring the
resistance of each cable.

2. If a short circuit is still detected after all related connectors have
been unhooked, remove the printed–circuit boards from the
control section, one by one, to determine whether any
printed–circuit board is short–circuited.

3. If neither a short circuit nor a ground fault is detected, check
whether the input unit operates normally.  (This method is not
applicable to the power supply unit AI.)
(a) Remove the connector CP11 from the bottom of the power

supply unit, and measure the voltage across pins 1 and 2.  If
200 VAC is output for about one second after the power on
button is pressed, at least half the input unit is normal.

(b) With the connector CP11 detached, connect pins 5 and 6 with
a jumper wire, then turn on the power.  If 200 VAC is output
continuously, the input unit is normal.

CNC is reading an axis command (X,Y,Z,...) in a program and giving the
command to the axis.

CNC is reading a dwell command (G04) in a program and is executing
the dwell command.

Positioning (G00) to a specified position of a specified axis is not
completed.
Whether positioning is completed or not is checked as the servo position
error amount.  Check it CNC’s diagnostic function as follows:

DGN no.800 Position Error  > PARAM 500 In–position width

Position error amount almost becomes 0, when positioning of an axis
completes and when the amount becomes within the in–posiiton width,
it is assumed that positioning completes and the next block is exected.
If position error amount does not become within the in–position width,
refer to servo alarm 400, 4n0 and 4n1.

Actual feedrate is overridden by the override signals to a programmed
feedrate.  Check the override signals using the PMC’s diagnostic function

of position error amount.

Rotated ?
· Chagne the return start position.
· Move the machine at faster that 128

pulses for more than one rotation to
wards RP.

Check that voltage of pulse coder is higher than 4.75 V.
To measure pulse coder voltage, remove the motor cover and measure on
pulse coder PCB at across + and – or +5V and 0V terminals.

· Caused  by wire resistance
check wire material

Change the power supply .

NOTE
After the pulse coder or motor is exchanged, reference
position or machine’s standard point may be different from
former one.  Please set it correctly.

A speed more than 128 pulses is required because if speed is lower that
this, one–rotation signal does not function stably, causing improper
position detection.

218

Absolute position data in the serial pulse coder was lost. 
(This alarm will be generated when serial pulse coder is exchanged or
position feedback signal cable of the serial pulse coder is disconnected).

Machine position must be memorized using the following method:

(1) Execute manual reference position return only for an axis for which
this alarm was generated.When manual reference position return
cannot be executed because of an another alarm, change parameter
0021 and release the alarm and perform manual operation.

(2) Press RESET  key at the end of reference position return to release the

alarm.

Execute dogless reference position setting to memorize the reference
position.

Since the reference position is different from the former one, change the
grid shift value (PRM No.508 to 511, 641, 642, 7508, 7509) to correct the
position.

This alarm is generated when absolute pulse coder battery becomes low.

Replace the batteries in the battery box connected to the connector of axis
cards (CPA9 for the 1st– to 4th–axis cards, CPA10 for the 5th–/6th–axis
card, and CPA11 for the 7th/8th–axis card).

When a type–B axis board is being used with a built–in absolute pulse
coder and an α or β series amplifier, the battery is installed in the servo
amplifier.  In such a case, replace the battery as described in the
appropriate manual supplied with the servo amplifier.

NOTE
1 When replacing the batteries for the � series servo amplifier

module, keep the power to the servo amplifier switched on.
2 Note that we are not supposed to replace the batteries for

the control unit (for memory backup).

Procedure for replacing batteries for absolute pulse coder (separate type pulse coder)

1 Prepare 4 alkaline batteries (UM–1type) commercially available in
advance.

2 Turn machine (CNC) power ON.  (When replacing the batteries, keep
the power to the NC switched on.  If the batteries are replaced with the
power switched off, all data relating to the absolute position will be
lost.)

3 Loosen screws on the battery case to remove the cover.  For placement
of the battery case, refer to the machine tool builder’s manual.

408 : Indicates that, in a system using serial spindles, the spindle 
amplifier does not start normally when power is applied.

This alarm will not occur once the system (including the spindle control
unit) has started.  It can occur before the system starts during power
turn–on processing.  Once the system has started, an error is indicated as
system alarm 945.

(1) The fiber optics cable is poorly connected, or the power to the spindle
amplifier is turned off.

(2) An attempt was made to switch the NC power on when the spindle
amplifier display was SU–01 or any alarm condition other than

This condition occurs mainly if the NC power is switched off when
the serial spindles are running.  In this case, switch the power to the

These alarms indicate RAM parity errors.

RAM is provided with a check bit (parity bit).  When data is written to
RAM, the check bit is also written to the RAM by either setting it to 1 or
resetting it to 0 so that the total number of 1 bits in the data, including the
check bit, is even or odd.  When the data is read from RAM, the check bit
is used to ensure that the read data is correct.

    UNIT FOR SERIES 00APPENDIX

283

The installation conditions and method for the CRT/MDI for the Series
00 are basically the same as in 9″ CRT/MDI unis.  Therefore, refer to item
3 in the text.  Follow this reference material, however, for the following
items.

This unit’s heating value is about 170 W.  The pendant, etc. on which to
mount this unit should be designed as follows so that the inside
temperature does not rise more than 15�C above the outside temperature.

1) Heat absorber

The conventional 14″ CRT/MDI unit heat absorber has insufficient
radiation.  A special heat absorber is available for this unit.  (It is a little
different from the conventional 14″ CRT/MDI unit heat absorber in
size.)

2) Air agitation fan in cabinet

An air agitation fan (1) should be installed at the position shown in the
figure below so that air flows between the printed circuit boards at
0.5m/sec. (A special fan unit is available.)

 :  The throughput was improved by employing a high–speed CPU.
 :  Same performance as before

In a system with a printed–circuit board incorporating a high–speed CPU
and a software version modified for the high–speed CPU, it is possible to
forcibly reduce the throughput to the conventional level (usually set to 0).
If the A20B–2002–0650 is being used as the master printed circuit board,
this parameter must be set to 0.
