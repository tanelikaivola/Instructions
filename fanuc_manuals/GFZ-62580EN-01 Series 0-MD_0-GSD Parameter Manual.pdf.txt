desired parameter number in the stated order, then press the
[INPUT] button.  The desired number will be searched for.  Using
the cursor/page key can also switch the screen sequentially.

(B–1) Bit–type parameter
Specify 0 or 1 in the 8 bits of the parameter.  One parameter
consists of 8 bits.  Bit 7 is the highest bit, and bit 0 is the lowest.
It is impossible to set or reset an individual bit separately from
another bit.  All bits must be manipulated simultaneously.
Example)

If you want to change “00001000” to “10001000”, key in
“10001000” [INPUT].
The highest bit must be entered first, then the next highest,
and so on.  The lowest bit must be entered last.  If only less
than 8 bits are entered, any bit left unspecified is regarded
as 0.
“1001[INPUT]” is equivalent to “0001001[INPUT]”.

(B–2) Nonbit–type parameter
Key in a value within the valid data range, and press the
[INPUT] button.

3) Resume the setting that was changed in item 1).

NOTE
Set all parameters that were not explained to 0.

Least input increment (input unit):
The unit of measure used in programming.  The least input increment
varies with the increment system used (1/10 or 10 times).  For the linear
axis, it also varies depending on whether a metric or inch input is selected.

Least command increment (output unit):
The unit of measure used by the NC when it gives instructions to the
machine.  The least command increment varies depending on whether the
machine is a metric or inch type.

(1)REVX:

REVY: Specify whether to enable a mirror image for the X/Y–axis.

1: Enable

0: Disable

NOTE
If a mirror image is enabled for an axis, the movement of the
axis is reversed during automatic operation except for a
movement from the middle point to the reference position
for an automatic reference position return.  The mirror image
function is ineffective during manual operation.

(2)TVON: Specifies whether to make a TV check when a program is
registered in memory.

1 : Makes a TV check.

0 : Does not make a TV check.

NOTE
1 The TV check (tape vertical parity check) function makes a

parity check for each block.  This function issues an alarm
(P/S 002) if one block (from one EOB to the next EOB)
contains an odd number of characters.

2 Parameter No. 0018#6 (TVC) determines whether to make
a TV check on comments in a program.

(3) ISO: Specifies which code system is to be used in outputting a
program from memory.

Setting of grid shift amount of X , Y , Z and 4th axis, respectively.

[Setting value] 0 to �32767 (detection unit).

 When the reference point is shifted, the sign of this parameter is necessary.

(1)Reference point return procedure (Grid method)

Select manual continuous feed mode, and turn signal ZRN on (connect
it with +24V).  When feed towards the reference point is designated
with the manual feed button, the moving part of the machine moves
at rapid traverse.  When the deceleration limit switch is operated and
the contact of reference point return deceleration signal *DCX, *DCY,
*DCZ, *DC4 opens, and the feed is decelerated.Thereafter, the
moving part moves at a pre– determined low speed.
Thereafter, when the deceleration limit switch is operated and the
moving part reaches the electric grid position, feed stops, and
reference point return completion signal ZPX, ZPY, ZPZ, ZP4 is
output.  The direction in which an axis is returned to reference point
can be set for each axis.  

Once an axis is returned to reference point and the corresponding
signal ZPX, ZPY, ZPZ or ZP4 is output, jog feed for that axis is  invalid
until signal ZRN is turned off.

Setting the parameters related to S analog output

For an analog interface spindle, a voltage of between 0 and 10 V is used
to control the spindle motor.  In the NC, however, 12–bit integers between
0 and 4095 (= FFFh) are used, thus supporting a resolution of 4096 steps.
The minimum voltage increments are thus 10/4095 V.

Conversion from the value of a constant to a voltage

Voltage (V) = 
Value

4095
 � 10 [V]

Example:  
When the value of a constant is 3071

Voltage (V) = 
3071

4095
 � 10 [V] = 7.5 [V]

1) No. 0542:  Sets the constant which specifies the upper limit on the
output to the spindle motor.

2) No. 0543:  Sets the constant which specifies the lower limit on the
output to the spindle motor.

Clamping and gear switching are based on the voltages equivalent to
these constants.

Example:

Spindle motor speed when the specified voltage is 10 V 
(specific to the motor) = 6000 [rpm]

Upper limit on the spindle motor speed (specified by the user) = 
5000 [rpm]

Lower limit on the spindle motor speed (specified by the user) =
50 [rpm]

Given the above conditions, set the parameters as follows:

No. 0542 = 

Upper limit on the spindle motor speed
(specified by the user)

Spindle motor speed when the specified voltage is 10 V
(specific to the motor)

� 4095

= 
5000 [RPM]

6000 [RPM]
� 4095 = 3413 (equivalent to approx. 8.33 V)

No. 0543 = 

Lower limit on the spindle motor speed 
(specified by the user)

Spindle motor speed when the specified voltage is 10 V 
(specific to the motor)

� 4095

Set with the distance from the reference point.
In the case of diameter designation, set with the diameter designation
value.  
The outside of the boundary set with the parameter is set as the inhibited
region.  Normally, set at the max. stroke of the machine. 
When the axis enters the inhibited region, overtravel alarm is indicated.
A margin should be provided with respect to the stroke to cope with the
fluctuation in the detecting operation.  As a rule, in the case of metric
designation, multiply the rapid traverse by a factor of 1/5 and set it as the
margin.

Example) Rapid traverse 10 m/min.
10 � 1/5 = 2 mm
The actual position of the machine slightly differs from the
position stored in the CNC unit after the power is turned on,
emergency stop is reset, or servo alarm is reset.  Therefore,
before starting operation, be sure to return the axes to reference
point.  Otherwise, overtravel detecting position deviates by the
value corresponding to the above–described deviation in the
position.

becomes infinite.

B–62580EN/014. DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS

108

Up to 128 pitch error compensation points can be set.  Among them,
specify the pitch error compensation point that corresponds to the
reference position, as the pitch error compensation origin.  In the
following example, the pitch error compensation number corresponding
to the reference position is set to 33:

Reference position

Compensation point34 35 36 3733323130

1000 Pitch error compensation origin for the X–axis

to

4000 Pitch error compensation origin for the 4th axis

[Data range] 0 to 128

[Description] These parameters are used to set the number of the pitch error
compensation origin for each axis.

Set the pitch error compensation for each compensation interval.  The
pitch error compensation can be set within a range of 0 to �7.  The actual
compensation values are obtained by multiplying the set values by a
magnification specified with a parameter.

Example:

� Machine stroke : –400 mm to +800 mm

� Pitch error compensation origin :  40

� Pitch error compensation interval : 50 mm

� Farthest compensation number in the positive direction = 
(compensation origin number) + 
(positive stroke/compensation interval) = 40 + 800/50= 56

� Farthest compensation number in the negative direction = 
(compensation origin number) – 
(negative stroke/compensation interval) + 1 = 40 – 400/50 + 1 = 33

B–62580EN/014. DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS

110

For a rotation axis, pitch error compensation of rotation axis type is
performed, such that any compensation points in the negative direction
are ignored.  The result obtained by adding one to the result of dividing
the angle corresponding to a single revolution (360000) by the pitch error
compensation interval is set as the number of compensation points for a
rotation axis.

Set 0 as the pitch error compensation origin.  Set an identical value for the
pitch error compensation for both compensation points 0 and n.

Example:
When the pitch error compensation interval is set to 6°.

divided exactly by that value, without a remainder.
Otherwise, compensation will not be performed normally.

2 The sum of the compensation values for a single revolution
must be 0.
