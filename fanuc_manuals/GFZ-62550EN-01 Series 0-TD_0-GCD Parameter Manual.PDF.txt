1) Preparation

(A) Select the MDI mode.

(B) Press the function button [DGNOS/PARAM] to display the
parameter setting screen.

(C) Key in address “No.” and value “0” in the stated order, then press
the [INPUT] button; the setting parameter screen will appear.  Set
PWE = 1.

(D) Executing the above steps enables parameter input.

2) Setting

(A) On the parameter setting screen, key in address “No.” and the
desired parameter number in the stated order, then press the
[INPUT] button.  The desired number will be searched for.  Using
the cursor/page key can also switch the screen sequentially.

(B–1) Bit–type parameter
Specify 0 or 1 in the 8 bits of the parameter.  One parameter
consists of 8 bits.  Bit 7 is the highest bit, and bit 0 is the lowest.
It is impossible to set or reset an individual bit separately from
another bit.  All bits must be manipulated simultaneously.

Example)
If you want to change “00001000” to “10001000”, key in
“10001000”[INPUT].
The highest bit must be entered first, then the next highest,
and so on.  The lowest bit must be entered last.  If only less
than 8 bits are entered, any bit left unspecified is regarded
as 0.

Example)
“1001[INPUT]” is equivalent to “0001001[INPUT]”.

(B–2) Nonbit–type parameter
Key in a value within the valid data range, and press the
[INPUT] button.

3) Resume the setting that was changed in item 1).

the increment system used (1/10 or 10 times).  For the linear axis, it also varies
depending on whether a metric or inch input is selected.

Least command increment (output unit):
The unit of measure used by the NC when it gives instructions to the
machine.  The least command increment varies depending on whether the
machine is a metric or inch type.

Detection increment:
The unit of measure used in detecting the machine position.

IS–A:
The input/output unit is 0.01 [mm]/0.001 [inch].

IS–B:
The input/output unit is 0.001 [mm]/0.0001 [inch].

IS–C:
The input/output unit is 0.0001 [mm]/0.00001 [inch].

1) If a parameter with “POWER OFF” is rewritten, the P/S 000 alarm
(turn off the power) occurs.  In this case, it is necessary to turn off the
power.  This also applies when the programmable parameter input

For rapid traverse block overlap, the feedrate ratio at which the next block
will be started is set.  If this parameter is set to 80, the next block is started
once the feedrate has decelerated to 80% at the end point of the current

75

[Data range] 0 to �99999999

Set with the distance from the reference point.
In the case of diameter designation, set with the diameter designation
value.
The outside of the boundary set with the parameter is set as the inhibited
region.  Normally, set at the max. stroke of the machine. 
When the axis enters the inhibited region, overtravel alarm is indicated.
A margin should be provided with respect to the stroke to cope with the
fluctuation in the detecting operation.  As a rule, in the case of metric
designation, multiply the rapid traverse by a factor of 1/5 and set it as the
margin.

Example) Rapid traverse 10 m/min.
10 � 1/5 = 2 mm

The actual position of the machine slightly differs from the position stored
in the CNC unit after the power is turned on, emergency stop is reset, or
servo alarm is reset.  Therefore, before starting operation, be sure to return
the axes to reference point.  Otherwise, overtravel detecting position
deviates by the value corresponding to the above–described deviation in
the position.
When the parameters are set as follows, the stroke limit becomes infinite.

LT1�1<LT1�2

Axis name

Example) LT1Z1 = –1 and LT1Z2 = 1
the Z axis stroke becomes infinite.

Setting pitch error compensation

Pitch error compensation points are located at equal intervals, specified
for each axis.  Pitch error compensation is performed at the midpoint of
each compensation interval.  (See the following figure.)

If the compensation interval is set to 0, pitch error compensation is not
performed for that axis.  The minimum interval between pitch error
compensation points is limited to the following value:

Minimum pitch error compensation interval = Maximum rapid traverse rate/1875

Example:  
When the maximum rapid traverse rate is 15000 mm/min, the
minimum interval between pitch error compensation points is 8 mm.

B–62550EN/014. DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS

84

Up to 128 pitch error compensation points can be set.  Among them,
specify the pitch error compensation point that corresponds to the
reference position, as the pitch error compensation origin.  In the
following example, the pitch error compensation number corresponding
to the reference position is set to 33:

1000 Pitch error compensation origin for the X–axis

to

3000 Pitch error compensation origin for the 3rd axis

[Data range] 0 to 128

[Description] These parameters are used to set the number of the pitch error
compensation origin for each axis.

Set the pitch error compensation for each compensation interval.  The
pitch error compensation can be set within a range of 0 to �7.  The actual
compensation values are obtained by multiplying the set values by a
magnification specified with a parameter.

Example:

� Machine stroke : –400 mm to +800 mm

� Pitch error compensation origin :  40

� Pitch error compensation interval : 50 mm

� Farthest compensation number in the positive direction = 
(compensation origin number) + 
(positive stroke/compensation interval) = 40 + 800/50= 56

� Farthest compensation number in the negative direction = 
(compensation origin number) – 
(negative stroke/compensation interval) + 1 = 40 – 400/50 + 1 = 33

B–62550EN/014. DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS

86

For a rotation axis, pitch error compensation of rotation axis type is
performed, such that any compensation points in the negative direction
are ignored.  The result obtained by adding one to the result of dividing
the angle corresponding to a single revolution (360000) by the pitch error
compensation interval is set as the number of compensation points for a
rotation axis.

Example:
When the pitch error compensation interval is set to 6°.

NOTE
1 Set a compensation interval such that 360000 can be

divided exactly by that value, without a remainder.
Otherwise, compensation will not be performed normally.

must be 0.
