Supplemental remark 1 
 If the DNC operation is performed with FOCAS1/HSSB, the 

setting of parameter No. 20 does not matter. The DMMC signal 
<G042.7> is used. 

Supplemental remark 2 
 If bit 0 (IO4) of parameter No. 110 is set to control the I/O 

channels separately, the I/O channels can be divided into four 
types: input and output in the foreground and input and output in 
the background. If so, parameter No. 20 becomes a parameter for 
selecting the input device in the foreground. 

 

Data is transferred between the CNC and a 
power mate CNC in group n (n: 0 to 15) via the 
FANUC I/O Link.

4.2 PARAMETERS OF READER/PUNCHER INTERFACE, 
REMOTE BUFFER, DNC1, DNC2, AND M-NET INTERFACE 

 
Before data (programs, parameters, and so on) can be input from and 
output to an external input/output device via the input/output device 
interface (RS-232-C serial port), the parameters explained below must 
be set. 
In the I/O CHANNEL setting parameter, the input/output device to be 
used is selected by specifying one of the two channels (RS-232-C 
serial port 1 and RS-232-C serial port 2) that is connected to the 
input/output device. 
In addition, the specifications of an input/output device connected to 
each channel (such as the specification number, baud rate, and number 
of stop bits of the input/output device) must be set in parameters 
corresponding to each channel in advance. 
For channel 1, two combinations of parameters to specify the 
input/output device data are provided. 
The following shows the interrelation between the input/output device 
interface parameters for the channels.

- 17 - 

NOTE 
 In general, reading is performed more efficiently 

when ND3 set to 1. This specification reduces the 
number of buffering interruptions caused by 
reading of a series of blocks specifying short 
movements. This in turn reduces the effective cycle 
time. 

 
 IOP Specifies how to stop program input/output operations. 

0 : An NC reset can stop program input/output operations. 
1 : Only the [STOP] soft key can stop program input/output 

operations. (An reset cannot stop program input/output 
operations.)

 IO4 Separate control of I/O channel numbers is: 

0:  Not performed. 
1:  Performed. 
If the I/O channels are not separately controlled, set the input/output 
device in parameter No. 20. 
If the I/O channels are separately controlled, set the input device and 
output device in the foreground and the input device and output device 
in the background in parameters No. 20 to No. 23 respectively. 
Separate control of I/O channels makes it possible to perform 
background editing, program input/output, and the like during the 
DNC operation.

 [Data type] Bit axis 
 RTLx The reference position return operation for a rotation axis is: 

0 : Of rotation axis type. 
1 : Of linear axis type. 
 

NOTE 
 The rotation axis type reference position return 

operation and the linear axis type reference 
position return operation differ in behavior as 
follows, depending on when the dog (the 
deceleration signal for reference position return) is 
pressed: 
• Linear axis type: 
  When the dog is pressed before the one-rotation 

signal is seized, P/S alarm No. 090 is issued. 
• Rotation axis type: 
  When the dog is pressed before the one-rotation 

signal is seized, the reference position return 
operation is continued without issuing an alarm. 

 
 ALZx An automatic reference position return operation causes: 

0 : A return to the reference position by positioning. 
 When a reference position return has not been performed even 

once since power-on, a return to the reference position is 
performed in the same sequence as for the manual reference 
position return operation. 

1 : A return to the reference position in the same sequence as for the 
manual reference position return operation. 

 
NOTE 
 This parameter has no influence on axes for which 

a reference position return is performed without 
dogs. 

 
 OKIx In reference position setting by pressing an axis against a stopper, 

after a reference position return is completed, P/S alarm 000 is: 
0 : Issued. 
 (If this setting is made, an absolute position detector is required 

when the function of reference position setting by pressing an 
axis against a stopper is used.) 

1 : Not issued. 
 (If this setting is made, no absolute position detector is required 

even when the function of reference position setting by pressing 
an axis against a stopper is used.)

NOTE 
 ROAx specifies the function only for a rotation axis 

(for which ROTx, #0 of parameter No.1006, is set

Examples 
 Suppose that the first axis is the X axis, and the second and 

subsequent axes are the Y, Z, and A axes in that order, and that 
they are controlled as follows: 

 X, Y, and Z axes: Controlled by the CNC 
 A axis: Controlled by the PMC 
 Then set this parameter to 3 (total 3: 1st to 3rd axes) 
 With this setting, the fourth axis (A axis) is controlled only by 

the PMC, and therefore cannot be controlled directly by the 
CNC.

 [Data type] Bit axis 
 IDGx The function for setting the reference position again, without dogs, is: 

0 : Not inhibited. 
1 : Inhibited. 
 

NOTE 
1 IDGx is enabled when the IDG parameter (bit 7 of 

parameter No.1002) is 1. 
2 When the function for setting the reference position 

without dogs is used, and the reference position is 
lost for some reason, an alarm requesting 
reference position return (No.300) is generated 
when the power is next turned on. If the operator 
performs reference position return, as a result of 
mistakenly identifying the alarm as that requesting 
the operator to perform a normal reference position 
return, an invalid reference position may be set. To 
prevent such an operator error, the IDGx 
parameter is provided to prevent the reference 
position from being set again without dogs. 
(1) If the IDG parameter (bit 7 of parameter 

No.1002) is set to 1, the IDGx parameter (bit 0 
of parameter No.1012) is automatically set to 1 
when the reference position is set using the 
function for setting the reference position 
without dogs. This prevents the reference 
position from being set again without dogs. 

(2) Once the reference position is prevented from 
being set for an axis again, without dogs, any 
attempt to set the reference position for the 
axis without dogs results in the output of an 
alarm (No.090). 

(3) When the reference position must be set again 
without dogs, set IDGx to 0 before setting the 
reference position.

 [Data type] Word axis 
 [Unit of data] 0.01 s-1 
 [Valid data range] 1 to 9999 

Set the loop gain for position control for each axis. 
When the machine performs linear and circular interpolation (cutting), 
the same value must be set for all axes. When the machine requires 
positioning only, the values set for the axes may differ from one 
another. As the loop gain increases, the response by position control is 
improved. A too large loop gain, however, makes the servo system 
unstable. 
The relationship between the positioning deviation (the number of 
pulses counted by the error counter) and the feedrate is expressed as 
follows: 

Feedrate

This parameter is used to set a positional deviation limit at servo-off 
time, on an axis-by-axis basis. 
If the value specified with this parameter is exceeded at servo-off time, 
a servo alarm (No.410) is issued to cause an immediate stop (same as 
an emergency stop). Usually, set the same value as a positional 
deviation at stop time (parameter No.1829). 
 

NOTE 
 When this parameter is set to 0, no positional

This parameter sets a servo error used to enable reference position 
return in manual reference position return. 
In general, set this parameter to 0.  (When 0 is set, 128 is assumed as 
the default.) 
 

NOTE 
 When bit 0 (PLC01) of parameter No.2000 is set to

Parameter No. 2141 Inductosyn data acquisition time 
 Set a time requirement for acquiring the Inductosyn 

data. If the setting is 0, 20 ms is assumed. (For the 
setting, contact the scale manufacturer.) 

 
1880  Unexpected disturbance torque detection alarm timer 

 
 [Data type] Word 
 [Unit of data] ms 
 [Valid data range] 0 to 32767 (200 msec is assumed when 0 is set) 

This parameter sets the time from the detection of an unexpected 
disturbance torque until a servo alarm is issued. The specified value is 
rounded up to the nearest integral multiple of 8 msec. 
[Example] 
 When 30 is specified, the value is rounded up to 32 (msec). 
 

1881  Group number when an unexpected disturbance torque is detected 
 

 [Data type] Byte axis 
 [Valid data range] 0 to 4 

This parameter sets the group number of each axis, used when an 
unexpected disturbance torque is detected. 
If an unexpected disturbance torque is detected for an axis, only the 
movement along the axes of the group containing the axis with the 
unexpected disturbance torque is stopped. If 0 is set for an axis, 
movement along that axis is stopped whenever an unexpected 
disturbance torque is detected for any axis. 
[Example] 
 Assume that the following settings have been made. If an 

unexpected disturbance torque is detected for the first axis, 
movement along the first, third, and fourth axes is stopped. If an 
unexpected disturbance torque is detected for the second axis, 
movement along the second and fourth axes is stopped.

Distance from the zero point of the encoder to the reference position 
        ＝No.1884×100,000,000＋No.1883 
 
The zero point of the encoder refers to the point at which mark 1 and 
mark 2 match. Normally, this point is a hypothetical point that does 
not physically exist on the encoder. (See the figure below.) 
If the reference position is located on the positive side when viewed

rotary encoder)) 
 
If it is difficult to measure the distance from the zero point of the 
encoder to the reference position (parameter No. 1883), the distance 
can be obtained by following the steps below: 
 

 1 Set the following parameters to use the encoder with absolute address 
reference marks (linear scale or rotary encoder):  
OPTx(No.1815#1)=1,DCLx(No.1815#2)=1,DCRx(No.1815#3)=0/1 
Set appropriate values in parameter Nos. 1821 and 1882. 
Set parameter No. 1240 to 0. 
Set parameter Nos.1883 and 1884 to 0. 

 2 Establish the reference position at an appropriate position. 
(As a result of this, the machine coordinate value shows the distance 
from the zero point of the encoder to the current position.) 

 3 Perform a jog feed or handle feed to position the machine at the 
accurate reference position. 

 4 In parameter No. 1883, set the result of the conversion of the machine 
coordinate value observed at this point of time (diagnosis screen No. 
301) into the detection unit (by multiplying the value on diagnosis 
screen No. 301 by CMR). 

 5 If necessary, set parameter No. 1240.

zero point of the encoder to the reference position 
exceeds 99,999,999. 

 
[Setting parameter No. 1883] (For an encoder with the absolute address zero point (linear scale or

 [Valid data range] 0 to 7 

When a separate detector interface unit is used, each of these 
parameters sets the value obtained by subtracting 1 from a separate 
detector interface unit connector number for each axis. That is, values 
of 0 through 7 are set for connector numbers 1 through 8. In addition, 
bits 6 and 7 of parameter No.1905 must be set.  For an axis that does 
not use a separate detector interface unit, 0 must be set. 
Any connector can be used for any axis, however the connectors in a 
single separate detector interface unit should be used in ascending 
order  
of connector number. For instance, connector 4 of a separate detector 
interface unit cannot be used without using connector 3 of the same 
separate detector interface unit.

NOTE 
 When automatic setting mode is selected for FSSB 

setting (when bit 0 of parameter No.1902 is set to 
0), these parameters are automatically set when 
input is performed with the FSSB setting screen. 
When manual setting 2 mode is selected for FSSB 
setting (when bit 0 of parameter No.1902 is set to 
1), these parameters must be set directly.

 Soft key [ALL] is displayed in the same position as 

soft key [ERASE]. Therefore, when soft key 
[ERASE] is pressed twice by mistake, offset data 
may be all cleared. 

 Since the position of soft key [ALL] is changed 
when this parameter is set to 1, it is possible to 
prevent offset data from being all cleared even 
when soft key [ERASE] is pressed twice by 
mistake.

This parameter sets a password for protecting program Nos.  
9000 to 9999. When a value other than zero is set in this parameter 
and this value differs from the keyword set in parameter No.3211, bit 
4 (NE9) of parameter No.3202 for protecting program Nos. 9000 to 
9999 is automatically set to 1. This disables the editing of program 
Nos. 9000 to 9999. Until the value set as the password is set as a 
keyword, NE9 cannot be set to 0 and the password cannot be 
modified. 
 

NOTE 
1 The state where password ≠ 0 and password ≠ 

keyword is referred to as the locked state. When an 
attempt is made to modify the password by MDI 
input operation in this state, the warning message 
"WRITE PROTECTED" is displayed to indicate that 
the password cannot be modified. When an 
attempt is made to modify the password with G10 
(programmable parameter input), P/S alarm 
No.231 is issued.

 [Data type] Word 
To prevent tool offset values from being changed by MDI key input 
operation using bit 0 (WOF) of parameter No. 3290 and bit 1 (GOF) 
of parameter No. 3290, set the inhibited range in this parameter. 
Set the start offset number of the tool offset values to be protected in 
parameter No. 3294 and the number of tool offset values from the start 
in parameter No. 3295. 
When 0 or a negative value is set in parameter No.3294 or parameter 
No.3295, no modification of the tool offset values is allowed. 
When the value set with parameter No.3294 is greater than the 
maximum tool offset count, no modification is allowed. 
[Example] 
 The following setting disables the modification of both the tool 

geometry compensation values and tool wear compensation 
values corresponding to offset numbers 51 to 60: 

 Bit 1 (GOF) of parameter No.3290=1 (Disables tool offset value 
modification.) 

 Bit 0 (WOF) of parameter No.3290=1 (Disables tool wear 
compensation value modification.) 

 Parameter No.3294 = 51 
 Parameter No.3295 = 10 
 If bit 0 (WOF) of parameter No.3290 is set to 0, the modification 

of the tool offset values alone is disabled. The tool wear 
compensation values may be modified.

The pitch error compensation positions are arranged with equal 
spacing. The space between two adjacent positions is set for each axis. 
The minimum interval between pitch error compensation positions is 
limited and obtained from the following equation: 
Minimum interval between pitch error compensation positions = 
maximum feedrate (rapid traverse rate)/7500 
Units:  
 Minimum interval between pitch error compensation positions: 

mm, inch, deg 
 Maximum feedrate: mm/min, inch/min, deg/min 
Example: 
 When the maximum feedrate is 15000 mm/min, the minimum 

interval between pitch error compensation positions is 2 mm. 
If setting a magnification causes the absolute value of the 
compensation amount at a compensation position to exceed 100, 
enlarge the interval between the compensation positions by using a 
multiple calculated as follows: 
Multiple =  maximum compensation amount (absolute value)/128  
   (Round the remainder up to the nearest integer.) 
Minimum interval between pitch error compensation positions

• Amount of movement per rotation: 360° 
• Interval between pitch error compensation position: 45° 
• No. of the compensation position of the reference position: 60 
If the above is specified, the No. of the farthest compensation position 
in the negative direction for the rotation axis is always equal to the

The No. of the farthest compensation position in the positive direction 
is as follows:

<Setting method> 
First, select servo axes which perform interpolation with the Cs 
contouring axis. (Up to three axes can be selected.) 
When there is no servo axis for interpolation with the Cs contouring 
axis, set the parameters 3900, 3910, and 3920 to 0 to terminate 
parameter setting. 
When there are servo axes for interpolation with the Cs contouring 
axis, the parameters must be set according to the procedure below for 
each axis. 
(1) Set the number of a servo axis (1 to 4) for interpolation with the 

Cs contouring axis in parameters 39n0 (n = 0, 1, and 2). 
(2) Set loop gain values of the servo axis specified in (1) above 

which is used when the Cs contouring axis is controlled in 
parameters 39n1, 39n2, 39n3, and 39n4. (There are four stages 
for main gears used.) 

(3) When the number of specified servo axes is less than 3, set the 
remaining parameters (39n0) to 0 to terminate parameter setting. 

When the number of a Cs contouring axis is set to parameter 39n0, the 
parameter is assumed to be set to 0. 
 

NOTE 
1 In general, it is difficult to set a high loop gain for a spindle motor axis when 

compared with a servo axis. These parameters are provided so that, by changing 
the loop gain of a servo axis that requires interpolation with the Cs contour axis, 
interpolation control can be exercised correctly between the Cs axis and servo axis 
while the spindle exercises Cs contour control. 

2 The loop gain of the servo axis is changed using the parameter settings made for a 
spindle gear selected at the time of conversion from the spindle mode to the Cs 
contour control mode. 

 In normal use, it is unlikely that the gear of the spindle is switched during Cs 
contour control. However, note that if the gear of the spindle is changed during Cs 
contour control, the loop gain of the servo axis is not changed. 

3 Even when multiple Cs axes are used (bit 7 (CSS) of parameter No. 3704 = 1), 
these parameters are shared.

Notes on parameters of the spindle amplifier with the serial interface 
 



4.DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS B-64120EN/01 
 

- 212 - 

NOTE 
1 Among the parameters of the spindle amplifier with the serial interface, parameters 

Nos. 4015 and 4191 cannot be changed by the users. 
 These parameters require to assign optional software to the CNC and are 

automatically set depending on the type of the software. 
2 To set the parameters of the spindle amplifier with the serial interface automatically, 

set #7 of parameter No.4019 (if the sub spindle is set in the CNC with the spindle 
switching function, use parameter No.4195) to 1, assign the model code of the 
motor to be used to parameter No.4133 (if the sub spindle is set in the CNC with 
the spindle switching function, use parameter No.4309), turn off the power of the 
CNC and spindle amplifier, and restart the CNC and spindle amplifier.  

3 Parameters No.4000 to No.4539 are used in the processing on the spindle 
amplifier. For details of these parameters, refer to either of the following manuals, 
depending on the serial spindle that is actually used. 
- FANUC AC SPINDLE MOTOR αi series Parameter Manual B-65280EN) 
- FANUC AC SPINDLE MOTOR α series Parameter Manual B-65160E) 

4 The CNC can control up to two spindle amplifiers with the serial interface. 
 When the spindle amplifier provides the spindle switching function, one spindle 

amplifier can control two spindle motors using the switching function. 
 The output switching function can be used in spindle motors to be connected. 
 Up to four spindles, or eight types, can be used by switching the spindle motors. 

(The number of spindles that can controlled simultaneously is the same as the 
number of spindle amplifiers, that is two spindles.) Parameters of the spindle 
amplifier with the serial interface correspond to the above functions as follows: 
(1) Parameter No.4000 to No.4539 "S1": First spindle amplifier 
 Parameter No.4000 to No.4539 "S2": Second spindle amplifier 
(2) Parameter No.4000 to No.4175 "S1"/"S2": When the spindle switching function 

is not provided, or for the main spindle in the spindle amplifier when the 
function is provided. 

 Parameter No.4176 to No.4351 "S1"/"S2": For the sub spindle in the spindle 
amplifier when the spindle switching function is provided. 

(3) Parameters at low speed when the output switching function is provided. 
 Parameters No.4136 to No.4175 "S1"/"S2": When the spindle switching 

function is not provided, or for the main spindle when the function is provided. 
 Parameters No.4284 to No.4351 "S1"/"S2": For the sub spindle when the 

spindle switching function is provided. 
 



B-64120EN/01 4.DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS 
 

- 213 - 

NOTE 
5 The CNC stores the parameters of the spindle amplifier with the serial interface. 

The CNC sends them to the spindle amplifier at the system power on and they are 
used in the unit. 

 These parameters are sent from the CNC to the spindle amplifier in a batch when: 
- The CNC is switched on. 
- The serial spindle is restarted by a reset that is carried out after spindle 

communication alarm 749 occurs (because the spindle control unit is switched off 
or because of noise). 

 If these parameters are rewritten, they are sent from the CNC to the spindle 
amplifier sequentially when: 
- The parameters have been entered from the MDI. 
- The parameters have been entered as programmable (G10). 
- The parameters have been entered via the reader/punch interface. 

 If bit 4 (WSP) of parameter No. 8703 is set to 0, the CNC does not immediately 
perform data transfer to the spindle amplifier even when data has been written to a 
parameter by using the PMC window function. So, the new parameter value set by 
rewriting does not become valid automatically. To perform data transfer 
immediately, set bit 4 (WSP) of parameter No. 8703 to 1. 

 If you want to change such parameter settings during automatic operation, use 
programmable parameter input (G10). 

 To set parameters automatically, upload parameters corresponding to the motor 
model from the spindle amplifier to the CNC prior to the procedure specified above. 

 The parameters of the spindle amplifier with serial interface can be changed after 
the system starts. Changing the parameters (No.4000 to No.4539 "S1", "S2") in the 
CNC sends them to the spindle amplifier at an appropriate time and the parameters 
in the unit are updated. Be careful not to change parameters incorrectly.

NOTE 
 The extended specification includes the following 

two extensions:  
(1) With the conventional specification, the number 

of M codes for specifying a spindle positioning 
angle is always 6. With the extended 
specification, an arbitrary number of such M 
codes from 1 to 255 can be selected by 
parameter setting (See parameter No.4964.) 

(2) The maximum feedrate for spindle positioning 
(setting of parameter No.1420) can be 
extended from 240000 to 269000 (in 
increments of 10 deg/min). 

 
 IMB When the spindle positioning function is used, half-fixed angle 

positioning based on M codes uses: 
0 : Specification A 
1 : Specification B 
 

NOTE 
 In the case of half-fixed angle positioning based on 

M codes, three types of spindle positioning 
operations can occur: 
(1) The spindle rotation mode is cleared, then the 

mode is switched to the spindle positioning 
mode.   

(2) Spindle positioning is performed in the spindle 
positioning mode.   

(3) The spindle positioning mode is cleared, then 
the mode is switched to the spindle rotation 
mode. 

 In the case of specification A: 
 Operations (1) to (3) are specified using separate 

M codes.  
(1) Specified using M codes for performing spindle 

orientation. (See parameter No.4960) 
(2) Specified using M codes for specifying a 

spindle positioning angle. (See parameter 
No.4962)  

(3) Specified using M codes for clearing spindle 
positioning operation. (See parameter 
No.4961.) 

 In the case of specification B: 
 When M codes for specifying a spindle positioning 

angle are specified, operations  
 (1) to (3) are performed successively. (See 

parameter No.4962.)

Two methods are available for specifying spindle positioning. One 
method uses address C for arbitrary-angle positioning. The other use 
an M code for half-fixed angle positioning. This parameter sets an M 
code for the latter method. 
• When bit 6 (ESI) of parameter No.4950=0 
 Six M code from M α to M(α+5) are used for half-fixed angle 

positioning, when α is the value of this parameter. 
• When bit 6(ESI) of parameter No.4950=1 
 Set the start M code in this parameter, and set the number of M 

codes in parameter No.4964. Suppose that the setting of 
parameter No. 4962 is α and the setting of parameter No. 4964 is 
β. Then β M codes from Mα to M (α+β-1) are used for half fixed 
angle positioning. 

The table below indicates the relationship between the M codes and 
positioning angles.

As many M codes as the number specified in this parameter, starting 
with the M code specified in parameter No.4962, are used to specify 
half-fixed angle positioning. 
Let α be the value of parameter No.4962, and let β be the value of

Set the servo loop gain multipliers of the spindle for gears 1 to 4. 
The multipliers are used to convert the amount of the position 
deviation to the voltage used in the velocity command. Assign the data 
obtained from the following equation to the parameters. 
Loop gain multiplier = 2048000 × E × A/L 

where; 
E : Voltage required to rotate the spindle motor at 1000 min-1 in the 

velocity command 
L : Rotation angle of the spindle per one motor rotation (normally 

360) 
A : Unit used for the detection (degree) 
 
[Example] 
 Let E be 2.2 V, L be 360 degrees, and A be 0.088 degrees/pulse. 

Loop gain multiplier = 2048000 × 2.2 × 0.088/360 = 1101 
* When the voltage specified for the spindle motor is 10 V at 

a spindle speed of 4500 min-1, E is regarded as 2.2 V.

 COD In pocketing, the sequence of axis movements made to return the tool 
to the start point at the end of machining is as follows:

 If this parameter is set to 1, specifying G71 causes 

the tool to return to the start point in the sequence 
from Z-axis to X-axis. Therefore, when the tool 
returns to the start point after end facing, 
interference between the tool and workpiece 
surface can be prevented.

When this parameter is set, the following function is also enabled: 
• When rigid tapping is specified in advanced preview control 

mode, the system automatically exits from advanced preview 
control mode and executes rigid tapping.  After termination of 
rigid tapping, the system automatically returns to look-ahead 
control mode. 

 RGS When bit 0 (MIF) of parameter No. 1403 is set to 1 and rigid tapping 
is specified in feed-per-minute mode, the spindle speed becomes: 
0 : 1/1000 of the specified speed. 
1 : 1/1 of the specified speed. 

 OVS In rigid tapping, override by the feedrate override signal and 
invalidation of override by the override cancel signal is: 
0 : Disabled. 
1 : Enabled. 
Setting this parameter enables override by the feedrate override signal 
<G012> to be applied for rigid tapping operation (cutting and 
extraction) in rigid tapping. 
The spindle speed override is fixed to 100%, but override is also 
applied to the spindle speed in synchronization with the feedrate along 
the tapping axis by feedrate override. 
The override cancel signal OVC <bit 4 of G006> also becomes 
available. 
 

NOTE

feedrate override is disabled by the override cancel 
signal OVC <bit 4 of G006>, override by 
parameters (see parameters Nos. 5211 (T/M) and 
5381 (M)) is enabled.

significantly affect the precision of threading. Conduct cutting tests, 
and make adjustments to obtain an optimum value. 
When performing threading with an analog spindle, also adjust the 
loop gain multipliers (parameter Nos. 5291 to 5294).

1 To use a varied loop gain on a gear-by-gear basis, 

set parameter No.5280 to 0, and set a loop gain for 
each gear in parameters No.5281 through 
No.5284. The specification of a loop gain on a 
gear-by-gear basis is disabled if parameter 
No.5280 is set to a value other than 0.  In such a

- 280 - 

This parameter sets the upper limit of the cutting feedrate that is 
effective during polar coordinate interpolation. If a feedrate greater 
than the maximum feedrate is specified during polar coordinate 
interpolation, it is clamped to the feedrate specified by the parameter. 
When the setting is 0, the feedrate during polar coordinate 
interpolation is clamped to the maximum cutting feedrate usually 
specified with parameter 1422.

 [Data type] Byte 
 [Unit of data] % 
 [Valid data range] 0 to 100 

This parameter sets an allowable percentage to find an allowable 
feedrate on a rotation axis in polar coordinate interpolation mode. A 
maximum cutting feedrate (parameter No.5462), multiplied by the 
allowable percentage set with this parameter represents an allowable 
feedrate. 
Allowable feedrate 
on rotation axis 

=
maximum cutting 
feedrate 

× allowable percentage 

 
In polar coordinate interpolation mode, the feedrate component on a 
rotation axis increases as the tool moves closer to the center of a 
workpiece. Near the center of a workpiece, the maximum allowable 
feedrate (parameter No.5462) may be exceeded. To prevent the 
feedrate component on a rotation axis from exceeding the maximum 
allowable feedrate in polar coordinate interpolation mode, the 
following override is automatically applied to the feedrate (automatic  
override): 

Allowable feedrate on rotation axis 
Override =

Feedrate component on rotation axis 
× 100 (%) 

 
If the overridden feedrate component for a rotation axis still exceeds 
the allowable feedrate, the feedrate is clamped to prevent the feedrate 
component on a rotation axis from exceeding a maximum cutting 
feedrate (automatic feedrate clamp). 
 

NOTE 
 When 0 is set in this parameter, a specification of 

90% is assumed. When a value of 100 or greater is 
set with this parameter, a specification of 100% is 
assumed. Before the automatic override function 
and automatic feedrate clamp function can be 
used, bit 1 (AFC) of parameter No.5450 must be 
set to

that the C-axis is directed at right angles to the direction of

block is performed.)

If this parameter is set to 1, and such an arc that the vector from the 
center of the arc to a start point rotates in the reverse direction after 
cutter compensation is specified during normal direction control in the 
cutter compensation C mode (see the tool path from (4) to (5) in the

When normal direction control is applied, the amount of movement 
(rotation angle) on the normal direction control axis (C-axis), 
calculated so that the C-axis is directed at right angles to the direction 
of motion at the start point of a block, may be smaller than the value 
specified in this parameter.  In such a case, the C-axis movement is 
not inserted before the movement (along the X-axis and Y-axis) 
specified by the block. Instead, the C-axis movement is performed 
together with the movement specified by the block. If the amount of 
movement (rotation angle) on the C-axis is greater than or equal to the 
value specified with this parameter, the C-axis movement is inserted, 
and the movement specified by the block is made after the completion 
of the C-axis movement. 
 

NOTE 
 This parameter is enabled when the SDC 

parameter (bit 0 of parameter No.5484) is set to 1. 
If a value equal to or greater than 180 degrees is 
specified, a C-axis movement is inserted only when 
circular interpolation involving a C-axis rotation of 
180 degrees or more is performed.

4.DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS B-64120EN/01 
 

- 298 - 

NOTE 
 There are two types of compensation: Types A and 

B. With the skip function, the current position is 
stored in the CNC according to the skip signal. 
However, the current position stored in the CNC 
contains servo delay. The machine position is 
therefore deviated by the servo delay. The 
deviation can be obtained from the position 
deviation of the servo and the error generated due 
to feedrate acceleration/deceleration performed by 
the CNC. If the deviation can be compensated, it is 
not necessary to include the servo delay in 
measurement errors. The deviation can be 
compensated with the following two types by the 
parameter as follows: 
(1) Type A:  The deviation is the value calculated 

from the cutting time constant and 
servo time constant (loop gain). 

(2) Type B:  The deviation is the error due to 
acceleration/deceleration and the 
position deviation when the skip 
signal goes on. 

 
 TSE When the torque limit skip function (G31 P99/98) is used, the skip 

position held in a system variable is: 
0 : Position that is offset considering the delay (positional deviation) 

incurred by the servo system. 
1 : Position that does not reflect the delay incurred by the servo 

system. 
 

NOTE 
 The torque limit skip function stores the current 

position in the CNC when the torque limit arrival 
signal is turned on. However, the current position in 
the CNC includes a servo system delay, so that the 
position is shifted from the machine position by an 
amount corresponding to the servo system delay. 
The value of this shift can be determined from the 
servo system positional deviation. When TSE is set 
to 0, a skip position is determined by subtracting 
the positional deviation from the current position. 
When TSE is set to 1, the current position 
(including the servo system delay) is used as the 
skip position, without considering any shift or 
position deviation.

the following: 
1 For the Cs contour controlled axis (spindle) that 

uses the torque limit skip function, set bit 4 of 
serial spindle parameter No. 4009 to 1 so that 
load detection signals are output even during 
acceleration/deceleration. 

2 If the load detection state (LDT1 = 1) is set when 
the torque limit command is specified (TLMH1 = 
1) in the Cs mode, no excessive error check at 
stop is performed for the axis. 

3 If the load detection state (LDT1 = 1) is set in 
the Cs mode, no in-position check is made for 
the axis.

Allowable number of pulses that can be accumulated during manual handle 

feed 
 

 [Data type] 2-Word 
 [Unit of data] Pulses 
 [Valid data range] 0 to 99999999 

If manual handle feed is specified such that the rapid traverse rate will 
be exceeded momentarily, those pulses received from the manual 
pulse generator that exceed the rapid traverse rate are accumulated 
rather than canceled. 
This parameter sets the maximum number of pulses which can be 
accumulated in such a case. 
 

NOTE 
 If the specification of manual handle feed is such 

that the rapid traverse rate will be exceeded, for 
example, when the manual pulse generator is 
rotated at high speed with a large magnification 
such as 100, the axial feedrate is clamped at the 
rapid traverse rate and those pulses received from 
the manual pulse generator that exceed the rapid 
traverse rate are ignored. In such a case, 
therefore, the scale on the manual pulse generator 
may differ from the actual amount of travel. If such 
a difference is not acceptable, this parameter can 
be set to temporarily accumulate the excess pulses 
in the CNC, rather than ignoring them, up to the 
specified maximum (pulses in excess of the set 
maximum are ignored). The accumulated pulses 
are output and converted to a move command 
once the feedrate falls below the rapid traverse rate 
by reducing the rotational speed of the manual 
pulse generator or stopping its rotation altogether. 
Note, however, that if the maximum number of 
pulses to be accumulated is too large, stopping the 
rotation of the manual pulse generator does not 
stop feeding until the tool moves by an amount 
corresponding to the pulses accumulated in the 
CNC.

 For an axis for which 0 is set, the first axis serves 

as the master axis. So, when the control signal for 
the axis is set to 1, the first axis serves as a master 
axis, and synchronous control is exercised. 

 
<For the M series>  

 [Valid data range] 0, 1 to Number of controlled axes 
Select a master axis and slave axis in simple synchronous control. Set 
a master axis number with the slave axis side. The axis number 
settings are: 1 → First axis, 2 → Second axis, 3 → Third axis, 4 → 
Fourth axis. Up to four pairs can be specified. 
 
Example1: 
 Simple synchronous control is exercised with one pair. 
 When using the first axis (X-axis) as the master axis, and the 

third axis (Z-axis) as the slave axis, set parameter No.8311 as 
follows: 

 Parameter No. 8311 X (first axis)  = 0 
     Y (second axis)  = 0 
     Z (third axis)  = 1 
     A (fourth axis)  = 0 
Example2: 
 Simple synchronous control is exercised with two pairs. 
 Assume that the following two pairs are to be used: 
 The master axis is the first axis, while a slave axis is the fourth 

axis. 
 The master axis is the second axis, while a slave axis is the third 

axis. 
 For this specification, set this parameter as follows: 
 Parameter No.8311 X (First axis)  = 0 
     Y (Second axis)  = 0 
     Z (Third axis)  = 2 
       (Fourth axis)  = 1

 2 When a spindle startup operation is being 
performed at the time of power-up and so on, or 
when serial spindle parameter data (parameter 
Nos. 4000 to 4799) is being rewritten through MDI 
keys, RS-232C, or programmable data input (G10), 
the serial spindle parameter data (parameter Nos. 
4000 to 4799) must not be rewritten with the PMC 
window function at the same time. 

3 When spindle orientation with the stop position set 
externally or incremental command type spindle 
orientation (both set by bit 2 (OR1) and bit 3 (OR2) 
of parameter No. 3702) is used, the same condition 
as described in NOTE 2 above applies if the status 
of the spindle orientation external stop position 
command signals (below) changes. When a 
change to the spindle orientation external stop 
position command signals and rewriting of spindle 
parameters (parameter Nos. 4000 to 4799) by the 
PMC window function are performed successively, 
insert a wait time of at least 50 ms between these 
operations.

4 When a parameter has been changed using this 

function, it requires 1000 ms for the new parameter 
data to become valid on the spindle amplifier side. 
To use a parameter as soon as changing it, wait for 
at least 1000 ms after the PMC window completion 
code is returned.

Inch machine 0.1 inch/min 6 to 6000 6 to 4800 
Rotation axis 1 deg/min 6 to 15000 6 to 12000 

 
When an overtravel alarm is issued during linear 
acceleration/deceleration before interpolation, deceleration is 
performed in advance so that the feedrate set in this parameter can be 
attained at the time of issuance of the alarm (when the limit is 
reached). Use of this parameter reduces the amount of overrun that 
occurs when the overtravel alarm is issued. 
If bit 2 (DS2) of parameter No. 1604 is set to 1, set in parameter No. 
12700 the feedrate to be attained when the overtravel alarm for stored 
stroke check 2 is issued. 
 

NOTE 
 When bit 2 (DS2) of parameter No. 1604 is set to 1, 

and parameter No. 12700 is set to 0, parameter 
No. 1784 is used.

This parameter sets the maximum cutting feedrate applied in HRV3 
mode for each axis. For a specified axis, the cutting feedrate is 
clamped at a maximum feedrate that does not allow the result of 
interpolation to exceed the maximum cutting feedrate for that axis.

14010 
 Maximum permissible movement amount at FL feedrate when the reference 

position is established with an encoder with the absolute address zero point 
(detection circuit C) 

 
 [Data type] 2-word axis 
 [Unit of data] Detection unit 
 [Valid data range] 0 to 99999999 

This parameter sets the amount of a movement made at the FL 
feedrate when the reference position is established with an encoder 
with the absolute address zero point (linear scale or rotary encoder) 
(detection circuit C). If the reference position is not established even 
when a movement is made by the amount set in this parameter or more, 
P/S alarm 5326 (Scale with the zero point: Failure in reference 
position establishment) is issued. When this parameter is set to 0, the 
maximum permissible movement amount at the FL feedrate at the 
time of reference position establishment becomes invalid. 
 

NOTE 
1 When the reference position is established under 

simplified synchronization control of the M series, if 
this parameter is set for one of the master and 
slave axes, the setting automatically applies also to 
the other axis. 

2 In angular axis control, the setting of this parameter 
is invalid for a Cartesian axis with which angular 
axis reference position is being established.
