3.2 SERVO AMPLIFIER MODULE

3.2.1 Abnormal Current Alarms (8, 9, A, b, C, d, and E in the LED
display)

(1) Make sure that the following parameters are set to the standard
values.  If they are not, abnormal current control is performed.

No. 1809 No. 1884 No. 1954(15-A),1955(15-B)

No. 2040 No. 8X40 No. 2041 No. 8X41 No. 2074 No. 8X74 No. 2098 No. 8X98

(2) Remove the power line wires from the amplifier terminals, and
release an emergency stop state.
→ If an abnormal current alarm is issued, the servo amplifier

module needs to be replaced.
→ If not, go to (3).

(3) Check for insulation between PE and each of the removed power
wires U, V, and W.  If insulation is perfect, go to (4).  If not,
disconnect the power wires from the motor connector.  Then
check for insulation between PE and each of the U, V, and W
terminals on the motor.
→ If there is a short-circuit between PE and  U, V, or W of the

motor, replace the motor.
→ If insulation is perfect, replace the power wires.

(4) Connect the power wires. Attach the check board (A06B-6071-
K290) to connector JX5 to measure the waveform of the actual
current (IR and IS) in the servo amplifier module.  Accelerate or
decelerate the motor, and measure the actual current (IR and IS) of
the amplifier.
→ If an abnormal current alarm occurs right after an emergency

stop state is released, go to (5).

Release an emergency stop state, and start the motor.
Check whether the waveform of the actual current (IR and IS) is a
normal sine wave.
→ If normal, go to (5).
→ If not, replace the amplifier.

(5) Check whether there is noise on the actual current (IR and IS)
waveform.
→ If there is no noise, replace the amplifier.
→ If there is noise, use a shielding wire, and ground the

shielding, or take other countermeasures as required.

3.2.2 IPM Alarms (8., 9., A., b., C., d., and E in the LED display; note
these codes are displayed simultaneously with a period.)

(1) Wait for about 10 minutes.  Then release the emergency stop state.
If an IPM alarm still occurs, go to (2).
If the cause is IPM overheat, the IPM alarm will not recur.  IPM
overheat can occur if the ambient temperature is high or the motor
is overloaded.  Check the operating condition.

(2) Remove the power wires from the amplifier terminals, and release
an emergency stop state.
If the IPM alarm does not recur, go to (3).

If the IPM alarm recurs, the probable cause is the operation of the
IPM protective function (for overcurrent or power failure).
Replace the amplifier and see.
→ If the IPM does not recur, go to (3).

(3) Check for insulation between PE and each of the removed power
wires U, V, and W.  If insulation is perfect, go to (4).  If not,
disconnect the power wires from the motor connector.  Then
check for insulation between PE and each of the U, V, and W
terminals on the motor.
→ If there is a short-circuit between PE and  U, V, or W of the

motor, replace the motor.
→ If insulation is perfect, replace the power wires.

(4) Connect the power wires.  Attach the check board (A06B-6071-

current (IR and IS) in the servo amplifier module.  Accelerate or
decelerate the motor, and measure the actual current (IR and IS) of
the amplifier.
If an overcurrent alarm occurs right after an emergency stop state
is released, go to (5).
Release an emergency stop state, and start the motor.
Check whether the waveform of the actual current (IR and IS) is a
normal sine wave.
→ If normal, go to (5).
→ If not, replace the amplifier.

(5) Check whether there is noise on the actual current (IR and IS)

rated value.

(2) Replace the servo amplifier.

3.2.4 DC Link Undervoltage Alarm (5 in the LED display)

(1) Check the three-phase input voltage to the power supply module.

(Alarm identification method)

#7 #6 #5 #4 #3 #2 #1 #0

<1>  Alarm 1 OVL LVA OVC HCA HVA DCA FBA OFA

(Action)

(1) Make sure that the motor is not vibrating.
⇒ If a motor vibrates, the current flowing in it becomes more

than necessary, resulting in an alarm.

(2) Make sure that the power line to the motor is connected correctly.
⇒ If the connection is incorrect, an abnormal current flows in

the motor, resulting in an alarm.

(3) Make sure that the following parameters are set correctly.
⇒ An overload alarm is issued based on the result of calculation

of these parameters.  Be sure to set them to the standard values.
For details of the standard values, refer to the parameter
manual (B-65150E).

1877 8x62 Overload protection coefficient (OVC1)

2062 1062

1878 8x63 Overload protection coefficient (OVC2)

2063 1063

1893 8x65 Overload protection coefficient (OVCLMT)

2065 1065

(4) Attach the check board (A06B-6071-K290) to connector JX5 to
measure the waveform of the actual current (IR and IS) of the
servo amplifier module.  Start the motor and measure the actual
current (IR and IS).
⇒ If the actual current exceeds 1.4 times the rated current, the

constant for the acceleration/deceleration duration is too
small, or the load on the machine is too heavy for the capacity
of the motor.

⇒ If the actual current exceeds 1.4 times the rated current during
normal operation, the load on the machine is too heavy for the
capacity of the motor.

(Action)
Action 1: This alarm is issued when a separate phase A/B scale is

used.  Check if the phase A/B detector is connected
correctly.

Action 2: This alarm is issued when the position feedback pulse
variation is small relative to the velocity feedback pulse
variation.  This means that this alarm is not issued when a
semi-full is used.  Check if the separate detector outputs
position feedback pulses correctly.  If position feedback
pulses are output correctly, it is considered that the motor
alone is rotating in the reverse direction at the start of
machine operation because of a large backlash between the
motor position and scale position.

absolute position data sent from the built-in pulse coder and

detach the pulse coder cable then attach it again.  If this
alarm is still issued, replace the pulse coder.

(Action)
Action 1: If this alarm is issued after a long-time of continuous

operation, it is considered that the motor and amplifier are
overheated.  Stop operation for a while, then make a check.
If this alarm is still issued after the power is off for about 10
minutes then is turned on again, the thermostat is
considered to be faulty.  If this alarm is issued intermittently,
increase the time constant or increase stop time in the
program to suppress the rise in temperature.

3.3.6 Invalid Servo Parameter Setting Alarm

The invalid servo parameter setting alarm is issued when a setting out
of the specifiable range is specified, or an overflow has occurred in an
internal calculation.  When an invalid parameter is detected on the

issued, check the battery voltage.  If the battery voltage
decrease alarm is issued, check the voltage, and replace the
battery as required.

Action 2: Alarms that may be issued for noise
If an alarm is issued intermittently or after emergency stop
cancellation, noise is probably the cause.  So, provide noise
protection.  If the same alarm is still issued after noise
protection is provided, replace the detector.

[Setting] Detection unit.  When 0 is set, no detection is made.

Action 3: The current offset value of the current detector (equivalent
to the current value in the emergency stop state) is
abnormally high.  If this alarm is still issued after the power
is turned off then back on, the current detector is faulty.  For
the i series, replace the control board of the amplifier.  For
series other than the i series, replace the servo-related
modules on the CNC.
