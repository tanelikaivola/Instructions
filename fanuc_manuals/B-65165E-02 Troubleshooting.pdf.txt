3.4.1.27 Alarm code 37

After emergency stop signal input, the motor is accelerated without
being decelerated.  This alarm is issued also when the motor is not
deactivated (the motor is not decelerated completely) when the
acceleration/deceleration time (initial parameter setting: 10 seconds)
has elapsed after emergency stop signal input.

Troubleshooting when this alarm is issued

Referring to Chapter 1 in "FANUC AC SPINDLE MOTOR
α series Parameter Manual (B-65160E)," set a correct time.

(b) The parameter setting of an acceleration/deceleration time is
not proper.
