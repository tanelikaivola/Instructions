2 WARNINGS RELATED TO CHECK OPERATION
WARNING

1. When checking the operation of the machine with the cover removed

(1) The user’s clothing could become caught in the spindle or other components, thus
presenting a danger of injury.  When checking the operation, stand away from the machine
to ensure that your clothing does not become tangled in the spindle or other components.

(2) When checking the operation, perform idle operation without workpiece.  When a
workpiece is mounted in the machine, a malfunction could cause the workpiece to be
dropped or destroy the tool tip, possibly scattering fragments throughout the area.  This
presents a serious danger of injury.  Therefore, stand in a safe location when checking the
operation.

2. When checking the machine operation with the power magnetics cabinet door opened

(1) The power magnetics cabinet has a high–voltage section (carrying a  mark).  Never
touch the high–voltage section.  The high–voltage section presents a severe risk of electric
shock.  Before starting any check of the operation, confirm that the cover is mounted on
the high–voltage section.  When the high–voltage section itself must be checked, note that
touching a terminal presents a severe danger of electric shock.

(2) Within the power magnetics cabinet, internal units present potentially injurious corners and
projections.  Be careful when working inside the power magnetics cabinet.

3. Never attempt to machine a workpiece without first checking the operation of the machine.
Before starting a production run, ensure that the machine is operating correctly by performing
a trial run using, for example, the single block, feedrate override, or machine lock function or
by operating the machine with neither a tool nor workpiece mounted.  Failure to confirm the
correct operation of the machine may result in the machine behaving unexpectedly, possibly
causing damage to the workpiece and/or machine itself, or injury to the user.

4. Before operating the machine, thoroughly check the entered data.
Operating the machine with incorrectly specified data may result in the machine behaving
unexpectedly, possibly causing damage to the workpiece and/or machine itself, or injury to the
user.



SAFETY PRECAUTIONS B–62545EN/02

WARNING

5. Ensure that the specified feedrate is appropriate for the intended operation.  Generally, for each
machine, there is a maximum allowable feedrate.  The appropriate feedrate varies with the
intended operation.  Refer to the manual provided with the machine to determine the maximum
allowable feedrate.  If a machine is run at other than the correct speed, it may behave
unexpectedly, possibly causing damage to the workpiece and/or machine itself, or injury to the
user.

6. When using a tool compensation function, thoroughly check the direction and amount of
compensation.  
Operating the machine with incorrectly specified data may result in the machine behaving
unexpectedly, possibly causing damage to the workpiece and/or machine itself, or injury to the
user.

3 WARNINGS RELATED TO REPLACEMENT
WARNING

1. Always turn off the power to the CNC and the main power to the power magnetics cabinet.  If
only the power to the CNC is turned off, power may continue to be supplied to the serve section.
In such a case, replacing a unit may damage the unit, while also presenting a danger of electric
shock.

2. When a heavy unit is to be replaced, the task must be undertaken by two persons or more.  If
the replacement is attempted  by only one person, the replacement unit could slip and fall,
possibly causing injury.

3. After the power is turned off, the servo amplifier and spindle amplifier may retain voltages for
a while, such that there is a danger of electric shock even while the amplifier is turned off.  Allow
at least twenty minutes after turning off the power for these residual voltages to dissipate.

4. When replacing a unit, ensure that the new unit has the same parameter and other settings as the
old unit.  (For details, refer to the manual provided with the machine.)  Otherwise, unpredictable
machine movement could damage the workpiece or the machine itself, and present a danger of
injury.

s–6

4 WARNINGS RELATED TO PARAMETERS
WARNING

1. When machining a workpiece for the first time after modifying a parameter, close the machine
cover.  Never use the automatic operation function immediately after such a modification.
Instead, confirm normal machine operation by using functions such as the single block function,
feedrate override function, and machine lock function, or by operating the machine without
mounting a tool and workpiece.  If the machine is used before confirming that it operates
normally, the machine may move unpredictably, possibly damaging the machine or workpiece,
and presenting a risk of injury.

2. The CNC and PMC parameters are set to their optimal values, so that those parameters usually
need not be modified.  When a parameter must be modified for some reason, ensure that you
fully understand the function of that parameter before attempting to modify it.  If a parameter
is set incorrectly, the machine may move unpredictably, possibly damaging the machine or
workpiece, and presenting a risk of injury.

5 WARNINGS AND NOTES RELATED TO DAILYMAINTENANCE
WARNING

1. Memory backup battery replacement

When replacing the memory backup batteries, keep the power to the machine (CNC) turned on,
and apply an emergency stop to the machine.  If this work is performed with the power on and
the cabinet open, only those personnel who have received approved safety and maintenance
training may perform this work.
When replacing the batteries, be careful not to touch the high–voltage circuits (marked  and
fitted with an insulating cover).
Touching the uncovered high–voltage circuits presents an extremely dangerous electric shock
hazard.

NOTE

The CNC uses batteries to preserve the contents of its memory, because it must retain data such as
programs, offsets, and parameters even while external power is not applied.
If the battery voltage drops, a low battery voltage alarm is displayed on the machine operator’s panel
or CRT screen.
When a low battery voltage alarm is displayed, replace the batteries within a week.  Otherwise, the
contents of the CNC’s memory will be lost.
To replace the battery, see the procedure described in Section 2.8 of this manual.

The complete connection diagram shows examples of connecting all PC
boards that can fit into the slots of the master PC board.  Some slots can
accept two or more PC boards which are connected to different devices.
This drawing shows two or more identical slot names, but actual
individual slots on the master PC board have different names.  See the
connection of each slot according to the PC board to be fitted into the slot.

The diagram shows the connection of all PC boards that can be fitted into
the slots.  In the actual unit, the PC boards to be mounted are determined
by the model and optional functions.  Note that all the PC boards shown
in the diagram are not always mounted.

Similarly to the pulse coder, the manual pulse generator is designed to
operate on 5 VDC.  So, any voltage drop relative to the supply voltage
must be kept to within 0.2 V (total drop through the 0 V and 5 V lines).
Namely:

0.2� 0.1� R� 2Lm
where 0.1 : Current required by the manual pulse generator

R : Wire resistance per unit length [Ω/m]
m : Number of wires in the 0 V or 5 V cable
L : Cable length [m]

CAUTION
To protect the signals from external noise, assign the cable’s
central pairs to each pair of current feedback signal and
ground signal (i.e., IRn and GDRn, and ISn and GDSn).
Otherwise, external noise may result in uneven feed or
abnormal sound.

For connection on control motor amplifier α series or β series,
refer to the Descriptions manual.

CABLE WIRING

RECOMMENDED CABLE MATERIAL A66L–0001–0284#10P(#28WAG�10 pair)

RECOMMENDED CABLE SPECIFICATION A02B–0120–K800(5m)

NOTE
1 The total length of the cable between the CNC and amplifier and that between the amplifier and

motor shall not exceed 50m.
2 As the current feedback lines (IRn and ISn), use the middle twisted pair of the recommended

cable.  If any other pair is used, abnormal noise or oscillation may occur.
3 Use a servo unit which supports the type–B interface.  When using a servo unit which supports

both the type–A and type–B interfaces, select the type–B interface.  For details, refer to the
manual supplied with the servo unit.  If the interface setting is incorrect, a servo alarm (AL401
V READY OFF) will be issued.

(2) Internal type pulse coder (Serial pulse coder interface)

The connector to which the feedback cable from the built–in pulse
coder is connected varies with the servo interface type.

For the type A interface, connect the feedback cable to the feedback
connector on the axis control card (for example, M185 for the first
axis).

For the type B interface, connect the feedback cable to the feedback
connector on the servo amplifier (for example, JF1 for the first axis).

(5) Handling of unused axes (Clamping)
The user can select any of the supported axes as the axes to be
controlled.  A cable for a servo amplifier or motor need not be
connected to those axes that are not to be used.  Leaving the connector
for an unused axis open, however, causes the CNC to enter a servo
alarm state.  This section describes how to handle (clamp) unused
axes.

NOTE
Servo parameters must also be set for clamped axes.  Set
the same servo parameters as those for any axis to be used.

(5)–1 Handling of the Command Connectors of Unused Axes
Connect a command clamping dummy connector to the
command connector of each unused axis.

A dummy connector is not necessary.  Set the relevant servo
parameters as follows and leave the feedback connectors
open.

Set the axis ignore parameter (bit 0 of No. 8n09:  n is the axis
number) for each unused axis to 1.  Set flexible feed gear
parameters 8n84 and 8n85 to 1.

The peripheral units, such as the control unit and CRT/MDI, have been
designed on the assumption that they are housed in closed cabinets.  In
this manual “cabinet” refers to the following:

� Cabinet manufactured by the machine tool builder for housing the
control unit or peripheral units;

� Cabinet for housing the flexible turnkey system provided by FANUC;

� Operation pendant, manufactured by the machine tool builder, for
housing the CRT/MDI unit or operator’s panel.

� Equivalent to the above.

The environmental conditions when installing these cabinets shall
conform to the following table.

Room temperature

The CNC has been steadily reduced in size using surface–mount and
custom LSI technologies for electronic components. The CNC also is
designed to be protected from external noise.  However, it is difficult to
measure the level and frequency of noise quantitatively, and noise has
many uncertain factors.  Generally, noise is induced in the CNC due to
electrostatic coupling, electromagnetic induction, and ground loop.
The CNC is equipped with provisions to minimize the influence of
extraneous noise.  However, it is difficult to quantitatively measure the
strength of the noise and how often it occurs.  Besides, noise has many
unknown elements.  To maintain the stability of the CNC machine tool
system, it is important to minimize the occurrence of noise and prevent
it from being induced into the CNC.
When designing the power magnetics cabinet, guard against noise in the
machine as described in the following section.

(1) Separationg signal lines

The cables used for the CNC machine tool are classified as listed in the
following table:
Process the cables in each group as described in the action column.

The signal ground (SG) supplies the reference voltage (0V) of the
electrical signal system.

� Frame ground system (FG)
The frame ground system (FG) is used for safety, and suppressing
external and internal noises.  In the frame ground system, the
frames, cases of the units, panels, and shields for the interface
cables between the units are connected.

� Connect the signal ground with the frame ground (FG) at only one
place in the CNC control unit.

� The grounding resistance of the system ground shall be 100 ohms
or less (class 3 grounding).

� The system ground cable must have enough cross–sectional area
to safely carry the accidental current flow into the system ground
when an accident such as a short circuit occurs.
(Generally, it must have the cross–sectional area of the AC power
cable or more.)

� Use the cable containing the AC power wire and the system
ground wire so that power is supplied with the ground wire
connected.

(3) Noise suppressor

The AC/DC solenoid and relay are used in the power magnetics
cabinet.
A high pulse voltage is caused by coil inductance when these devices
are turned on or off.
This pulse voltage induced through the cable causes the electronic
circuits to be disturbed.

� Use a spark killer consisting of a resistor and capacitor in series.  This
type of spark killer is called a CR spark killer.(Use it under AC)
(A varistor is useful in clamping the peak voltage of the pulse
voltage, but cannot suppress the sudden rise of the pulse voltage.
FANUC therefore recommends a CR spark killer.)

� The reference capacitance and resistance of the spark killer shall
conform to the following based on the current (I (A)) and DC
resistance of the stationary coil:

1) Resistance (R) : Equivalent DC resistance of the coil

2) Capacitance (C) :

(4) Cable clamp and shield processing

The CNC cables that require shielding should be clamped by the
method shown below.  This cable clamp treatment is for both cable
support and proper grounding of the shield.  To insure stable CNC
system operation, follow this cable clamp method.
Partially peel out the sheath and expose the shield.  Push and clamp
by the plate metal fittings for clamp at the part.  The ground plate must
be made by the machine tool builder, and set as follows :

Part programs, offset data, and system parameters are stored in the CMOS
memory of the control unit.  Three ”D”(R20) size alkaline batteries are
used to back up the memory of the control unit when the AC power source
is off.  These batteries are held in the battery unit.  The user is requested
to replace these batteries once a year.  When replacing the batteries, it is
necessary to keep the power supply switched on.  Note that if the batteries
are removed when the power supply is off, the contents (parameters and
programs) of memory will be lost.

If the battery voltage drops, the warning message ”BAT” appears on the
CRT screen, and a battery alarm signal is sent to the PMC.  If a battery
alarm occurs, replace the batteries as soon as possible (no later than within
one or two weeks).  Actually, however, the battery life depends on the
configuration of your system.

If the battery voltage drops even further, it will become impossible to provide
memory backup.  If the power is switched on under this condition, a system
alarm (SRAM party alarm) occurs, because the contents of memory will
have been damaged.  Therefore, after replacing the batteries, it is necessary
to clear the entire contents of memory and re–enter the necessary programs
and data.  Keep the power switched on when replacing the batteries.  Do not
forget that disconnecting the memory backup batteries with the power
switched off will result in the total loss of the memory contents.

Battery replacement method

1 Obtain three new ”D” (R20) size alkaline dry cells.

2 Switch on the power to the control unit.

3 Remove the battery case lid.

It is easy to mount and dismount the CNC power supply unit, because it
is designed to be mounted on, and connected directly to, the master
printed–circuit board.  All its AC inputs and DC outputs are linked via
connectors.

Because this power supply unit has a built–in input unit function, it is not
necessary to prepare a separate relay or input unit for switching the AC
input on and off.  The AC input can be connected directly to the power
supply unit.  The unit has an AC service outlet, which is switched on and
off simultaneously with the power supply unit.  This AC service outlet can
be used to supply power to a unit such as a fan motor.

Fig.2.7.1(a) is an outline of this power supply unit, and Fig.2.7.1(b) is the
block diagram.

(3) Adjustments and settings

This power supply unit requires no adjustment or setting.  Do not
attempt to adjust the reference voltage (=10.00V) at A10 unless
absolutely necessary, because the reference voltage has been adjusted
during unit test; merely confirm the voltage across A10 and A0 of
check connector CP16.
If the reference voltage at A10 falls outside the rated range, set it to
10.00V, using VR11, while measuring the voltage with a digital
voltmeter.  Rotating VR11 clockwise increases the voltage at A10.
After the power supply unit is replaced, always to check the reference
voltage at A10.

(4) Causes of blown fuses and required corrective actions

This power supply unit is provided with fuses F11 and F12 at its input,
fuse F13 at the +24 V output, and fuse F14 at the +24E output.
Possible causes of these fuses blowing are listed below together with
the corrective actions required to restore normal operation.

1. Fuses F11 and F12

(a) Short circuit in surge absorber VS11
VS11 is intended to suppress surge voltages on the input line.
If an excessively large surge voltage or steady voltage is
applied to VS11, it breaks down, short–circuiting and,
causing F11 and F12 to blow.  If VS11 has short–circuited,
but you do not have a replacement part on hand, the machine
can be used with VS11 removed.  In such a case, however,
you should obtain a replacement and install it as soon as
possible, especially when the machine is being used in an
installation prone to surge voltages.  The specification
number of VS11 is A50L–8001–0067#431U.

(b) Short circuit in diode stack DS11

(c) Short circuit between the collector and emitter of switching
transistors Q14 and Q15

(d) Short circuit in diodes D33 and D34

(e) Short circuit between the collector and emitter of transistor
Q1 in the auxiliary power supply circuit

If you suspect that any of short circuits (b) to (e) has  occurred in
the respective parts, replace the power supply unit with a spare.
When replacing a fuse, use a replacement having the same rating.
The specification number for fuses F11 and 12 is
A60L–0001–0245#GP75.

2. Fuse F13
(a) A short circuit may have occurred in the CRT/MDI unit or a

+24 V power supply cord leading to it.  Remove the cord from
CP15, and check the unit and cord carefully.

(b) A short circuit may have occurred in the +24 V circuit on the
master printed–circuit board.  Remove the cable from CP14
and CP15.  Also, remove the power supply unit from the
master printed–circuit board, then check the printed–circuit
board carefully.  When replacing a fuse, use a replacement
having the same rating.  The specification number for fuse
F13 is A60L–0001–0075#3.2.

3. Fuse F14
(a) Short circuit in +24E power supply cables for various

printed–circuit board units

(b) Ground fault of the +24E power supply line in the machine
or false contact of the +24E power supply line with another
power supply line

If either of (a) or (b) may have occurred, remove the cable from
CP14, and check it carefully.  When replacing a fuse, use a
replacement part having the same rating.  The specification
number for fuse F14 is A60L–0001–0046#5.0.



2. HARDWARE B–62545EN/02

68

4. Fuse F1
Fuse F1 and surge absorber VS1 are wired so that, if a high current
flows through VS1, it may cause F1 to blow.  This is intended to
protect the circuits in the power supply unit from an abnormal
voltage that may occur due to a failure in the auxiliary power
supply circuit of the power supply unit and an abnormal voltage
that may originate in the power supply ON/OFF switch contact
signal line or external alarm signal line.  If F1 blows, probable
causes are:

(1) Failure in the auxiliary power supply circuit (M1, Q1, T1,
D1, Q2, or ZD1)

(2) False contact between the power supply ON/OFF switch
contact signal line or external alarm signal line and the AC
power line

If cause (1) is more likely, replace the power supply unit. If cause (2) is
more likely, replace the power supply unit, because the power supply
unit may have failed.  After the power supply ON/OFF switch contact
signal line and external alarm signal line have been checked, and all
abnormal conditions (if any) have been cleared, if replacing F1 restores
normal operation, there is no need to replace the power supply unit.  The
specification number of fuse F1 is A60L–0001–0172#DM03.  When
replacing the fuse, use a replacement having the same rating.

It is necessary to regulary clean the heat transformer, because the heat
transformation ability will be reduced by the accumulation of dust.  The
frequency of the cleaning needed differs according to the installation
environment and therefore should be determined by your own judgment
according to the degree of dirt.

Air filter cleaning and replacement method

1 When cleaning and replacing the filter, be sure to cut off the fan’s
electric power source.

2 Detach the filter cover and take out the filter inside.

Detach the cover by pressing, the flanges
which are in the grooves of both sides 
towards the inside by minus screwdriver, etc.

3 Protect the filter from silting due to dust by blowing air on both sides.

4 When dirt is conspicuous, press wash with a neutral detergent, rinse
with fresh water, and the washing, allow to dry naturally.  When
replacing with the same product.

5 Insert the filter in the cover, align the flange in the groove, and install
by pressing.  Confirm that the cover will not come loose even if it is

[Remarks]

• The search function searches a signal in the forward direction and
displays the ladder with the searched signal at its head. Because there
may exist plural contacts, repeat the search operation to find plural
locations, repeat the search operation to find plural locations with the
specified signal.

• If a specified signal is not found up to the end of the program (ladder),
execution returns to the head of a program and search continues.

Is the CRT screen correct ?
If machining dimensions are incorrect

1) How large is the error ?

2) Is the position display on the CRT correct ?

3) Are the offsets correct ?

4 Other information

• Is there noise origin around machine?
If the failure has not occurred frequently, the cause may be external
noise to the power supply or inductive noise on machinery cables.
Operate other machines connected to the same power line and see
if noise come from the relays or compressors.

• Is it taken any countermeasure for noise in machine side? (See
2.3.11)

• Check the following for the input power supply voltage :
1) Is there variation in the voltage ?

2) Are the voltages different depending on the phase ?

3) Is the standard voltage supplied ?

• How high is the ambient temperature of the control unit?
(0�C to 45�C during operation)

• Has excessive vibration been applied to the control unit?
(0.5 G or less during operation)

1) Name of the NC unit

2) Name of the machine tool builder and type of machine

3) Software series/version of the NC

4) Specifications of the servo amplifier and motor

(for a failure related to the servo)

Check the LED on the power supply unit.

(1) If no power supply alarm is detected (the red ”ALM” LED does not
light):

1. If the PIL LED is off:

(a) Check the input fuse of the power supply unit.  Also, check
that 200 VAC is applied to connector CP1 of the power
supply unit, using a volt–ohm–milliammeter.  If the 200 VAC
cannot be detected at connector CP1, check the
corresponding circuit in the machine.

(b) If both the fuse and power supply voltage are normal, the
printed–circuit board of the input unit or the power supply
unit may be defective.

2. If the PIL LED lights, and the input voltage is normal:
Check whether the conditions for switching the power on are
satisfied.

Unhook connectors CP3 (or CP4 for a power supply unit designed to
satisfy CE marking requirements) from the front of the power supply
unit, then check the circuit corresponding to the power being turned
on and that corresponding to the power being turned off, as well as
the operation of the switch, using a volt–ohm–milliammeter.

(2) If a power supply alarm is detected (the red ”ALM” LED lights):

The most likely causes are a failure (short circuit or ground fault) or a
defective power supply unit.  Use the check procedure described below.

CAUTION
Do NOT detach the memory backup battery cable.

1. Switch the power off, then check for a short circuit or ground fault
between the DC voltage check terminals (+5V, +15V, –15V,
+24V, and +24E) and the 0V point.
(Overcurrent)
If a short circuit or ground fault is detected, locate its cause by
unhooking the related connectors, one by one, and measuring the
resistance of each cable.

2. If a short circuit is still detected after all related connectors have
been unhooked, remove the printed–circuit boards from the
control section, one by one, to determine whether any
printed–circuit board is short–circuited.

· Chagne the return start position.
· Move the machine at faster that 128

pulses for more than one rotation to
wards RP.

Check that voltage of pulse coder is higher than 4.75 V.
To measure pulse coder voltage, remove the motor cover and measure on
pulse coder PCB at across + and – or +5V and 0V terminals.

· Caused  by wire resistance
check wire material

Change the power supply .

CAUTION
After the pulse coder or motor is exchanged, reference
position or machine’s standard point may be different from
former one.  Please set it correctly.

A speed more than 128 pulses is required because if speed is lower that
this, one–rotation signal does not function stably, causing improper
position detection.

Absolute position data in the serial pulse coder was lost. 
(This alarm will be generated when serial pulse coder is exchanged or
position feedback signal cable of the serial pulse coder is disconnected).

Machine position must be memorized using the following method:

(1) Execute manual reference position return only for an axis for which
this alarm was generated.When manual reference position return
cannot be executed because of an another alarm, change parameter
0021 and release the alarm and perform manual operation.

(2) Press RESET key at the end of reference position return to release the
alarm.

Execute dogless reference position setting to memorize the reference
position.

Since the reference position is different from the former one, change the
grid shift value (PRM No.508 to 511) to correct the position.

axis board being used is type B and if the absolute pulse coder is a built–in
type, the batteries are installed in the servo amplifier.  Replace the
batteries as described in the appropriate manual.

CAUTION
1 When replacing the batteries for the � series servo amplifier

module, keep the power to the servo amplifier switched on.
2 Note that we are not supposed to replace the batteries for

Procedure for replacing batteries for absolute pulse coder (separate type pulse coder)

1 Prepare 4 alkaline batteries (UM–1type) commercially available in
advance.

2 Turn machine (CNC) power ON.  (When replacing the batteries, keep
the power to the NC switched on.  If the batteries are replaced with the
power switched off, all data relating to the absolute position will be
lost.)

3 Loosen screws on the battery case to remove the cover.  For placement

This alarm will not occur once the system (including the spindle control
unit) has started.  It can occur before the system starts during power
turn–on processing.  Once the system has started, an error is indicated as
system alarm 945.

These alarms indicate RAM parity errors.

RAM is provided with a check bit (parity bit).  When data is written to
RAM, the check bit is also written to the RAM by either setting it to 1 or
resetting it to 0 so that the total number of 1 bits in the data, including the
check bit, is even or odd.  When the data is read from RAM, the check bit
is used to ensure that the read data is correct.

If a parity alarm still occurs after the RAM has been cleared to all 0s,
it is likely that the printed–circuit board on which the RAM in which the
alarm has occurred is defective.  So, replace the printed–circuit board.
