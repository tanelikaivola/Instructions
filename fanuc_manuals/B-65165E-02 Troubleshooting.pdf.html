</p>
<p>The fuse of the DC link has blown.  (The voltage at the DC link is
insufficient.)  This alarm is checked when emergency stop is cancelled.
</p>
<p>(1) If this alarm is issued during spindle operation (rotation)
The fuse of the DC link inside the SPM has probably blown.  So,
replace the SPM.  This alarm may be caused by the following:
&lt;1&gt; Power line short-circuited to ground
&lt;2&gt; Motor winding short-circuited to ground
&lt;3&gt; IGBT or IPM module failure
</p>
<p>(2) If the PSM input magnetic contactor is once turned on and is
turned off with this alarm when emergency stop is cancelled or the
CNC is started (When two spindles are connected, the magnetic
contactor may not be turned off.)
(a) The DC link wire is not connected.
</p>
<p>Check the DC link (TB1) wiring for errors.
(b) A cable is faulty.
</p>
<p>Pin 9 of the interface cable (JX1B-JX1A) between the PSM

</p>
<p>The motor rotates at a speed exceeding 115% (standard setting) of the
maximum allowable speed.
</p>
<p>(1) If this alarm is issued during spindle synchronization
If the activation (SFR, SRV) of the motor on one side is turned off
then back on in the spindle synchronization mode, the spindle
motor is accelerated to correct a position error built up during the
period, thus causing this alarm.  Modify the ladder so that SFR
and SRV are not turned off in the spindle synchronization mode.
</p>
<p>(2) If this alarm is issued while the motor is stopped
(a) The connection cable of the spindle sensor is faulty.
</p>
<p>Check if the cable of the spindle sensor built into the motor
(BZ sensor when a built-in motor is used) is disconnected,
and replace the cable as required.
</p>

correctly.

</p>
<p>The temperature of the heat sink of the SPM main circuit has risen to
the set value.  This alarm is issued for SPM-15 and up or SPM-15HV
and later.  With SPM-2.2 to SPM-11 and SPM-11HV, however, alarm
code 12 is issued for the same cause.
</p>
<p>(1) If this alarm is issued during cutting (the heat sink temperature is
high)
(a) If this alarm is issued when the load meter reads a value
</p>
<p>below the continuous rating of the amplifier, check the
cooling state of the heat sink.
&lt;1&gt; If the cooling fan is stopped, check the power supply
</p>
<p>(connector CX1A/B).  If the cooling fan is still
inoperative, replace the SPM with a new one.
</p>
<p>&lt;2&gt; When the ambient temperature is higher than the
specified temperature, lower the ambient temperature
to satisfy the specification.
</p>

value above the continuous rating of the amplifier, improve
the use method.</p>

<p>A power element (IGBT, IPM) may be destroyed.  Replace

If the amplifier setting condition is not satisfied, or cooling is
insufficient because the heat sink is dirty, the power
elements may be destroyed.
When the heat sink on the back of the amplifier is too dirty,

</p>
<p>In the differential speed mode, the spindle speed on the master side
(remote) converted to a motor speed on the slave side (local) exceeded
the maximum allowable speed of the motor.
</p>
<p>Troubleshooting when this alarm is issued
A differential speed is calculated by multiplying the speed on the
target speed by a gear ratio.
Ensure that the maximum allowable speed of the motor is not
exceeded.
</p>
<p>3.4.2.9 Alarm code 50
</p>
<p>A value obtained by internal calculation in spindle synchronization
exceeded the allowable range.
</p>
<p>Troubleshooting when this alarm is issued
(a) The setting of parameters for gear ratio setting is incorrect.
</p>
<p>Check if an excessively large gear ratio is set.
(b) Position gain setting limit
</p>
<p>If correct gear ratio data is set, increase the position gain
value in spindle synchronization.

<p>3.4.2.13 Alarm code 55
</p>
<p>In spindle switching control or output switching control, a mismatch
between the switching request signal (SPSL or RSL) and the power line
state check signal (MCFN, MFNHG, RCH, or RCHHG) continues
during motor activation.
</p>
<p>Troubleshooting when this alarm is issued
(a) The magnetic contactor (switch unit) for power line
</p>
<p>switching is faulty.
If the contact is inoperative, check the power supply of the
magnetic contactor.  If the magnetic contactor is still
inoperative, replace the magnetic contactor.
</p>
<p>(b) The I/O unit or wiring for checking the contact of the
magnetic contactor is faulty.
If a defect is found in the I/O unit or wiring, replace the I/O
unit or wiring.
</p>
<p>(c) The sequence (ladder) is incorrect.
Modify the sequence so that switching is not performed
during activation.  For details of the signals, refer to Chapter
10, "Interface Signals," in "FANUC SERVO AMPLIFIER α
series Descriptions (B-65162E)."</p>
