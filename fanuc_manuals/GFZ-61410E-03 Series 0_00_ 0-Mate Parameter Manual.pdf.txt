Setting parameter

[SETTING I]

(1) REVX:
REVY: Specify whether to enable a mirror image for the X/Y-axis.

1: Enable
0: Disable

Note) If a mirror image is enabled for an axis, the movement of the axis is reversed during automatic operation except for a
movement from the middle point to the reference position for an automatic reference position return. The mirror image
function is ineffective during manual operation.

(2) TVON : Specifies whether to make a TV check when a program is registered in memory.
1 : Makes a TV check.
0 : Does not make a TV check.

Note 1) The TV check (tape vertical parity check) function makes a parity check for each block, This function issues an alarm
(P/S 002) if one block (from one EOB to the next EOB) contains an odd number of characters.

Note 2) Parameter No. 0018#6 (n/C) determines whether to make a TV check on comments in a program.

(8) PWE: ’ Specifies whether to enable parameter writing.
1: Enables.
0: Disables.

(9) REV4: Specifies whether to enable a mirror image for the fourth axis.
1: Enable
0: Disable

(IO) TAPEF: Specifies the type of a tape format.
1: Fl O/F1 1 format after conversion
0: FSO standard format without conversion

[SEQUENCE STOP]

(11) PRGNO: Program number where the sequence number check/stop function is applied.
SEQNO: Sequence number where the sequence number check/stop function is applied.

Note) The sequence number check/stop function places a program in a single block stop state if a block with a specified
program number and sequence number is executed. In this case, the SEQNO is decremented by one, but the PRGNO
does not change.

Parameter description

[Ol. Setting method]

1) Preparation
(A) Select the MDI mode.
(B) Press the function button [DGNOS/PARAM]  to display the parameter setting screen.
(C) Key in address “No.” and value “0” in the stated order, then press the [INPUTJ  button; the setting parameter screen will

appear. Set PWE = 1.
(D) Executing the above steps enables parameter input.

2) Setting
(A) On the parameter setting screen, key in address “No.” and the desired parameter number in the stated order, then press

the [INPUTJ button. The desired number will be searched for. Using the cursor/page key can also switch the screen
sequentially.

(B-l ) Bit-type parameter
Specify 0 or 1 in the 8 bits of the parameter. One parameter consists of 8 bits. Bit 7 is the highest bit, and bit 0 is
the lowest. It is impossible to set or reset an individual bit separately from another bit. All bits must be manipulated
simultaneously.
Example) If you want to change “00001000” to “10001000”, key in “10001 OOO’[INPUT].

The highest bit must be entered first, then the next highest, and so on. The lowest bit must be entered
last. If only less than 8 bits are entered, any bit left unspecified is regarded as 0.

Example) “1001 [INPUT]” is equivalent to “0001001 [INPUT]“.
(B-2) Nonbit-type parameter

Key in a value within the valid data range, and press the [INPUT] button.

3) Resume the setting that was changed in item 1).

Note)Set all parameters that were not explained to 0.

[02. Terminology]

Least input increment (input unit): . . . . . . . . . . The unit of measure used in programming. The least input increment varies
with the increment system used (l/l 0 or IO times). For the linear axis, it also
varies depending on whether a metric or inch input is selected.

Least command increment (output unit): . . . . The unit of measure used by the NC when it gives instructions to the machine.
The least command increment varies depending on whether the machine is a
metric or inch type.

Detection increment: , . . , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The unit of measure used in detecting the machine position.
IS-A: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The input/output unit is 0.01 [mm]/O.OOl [inch].
IS-B: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The input/output unit is 0.001 [mm]/O.OOOl  [inch].
IS-C: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . , . . . The input/output unit is 0.0001 [mm]/0.00001  [inch].

[03. Cautions]

1) If a parameter with “POWER OFF” is rewritten, the P/S 000 alarm (turn off the power) occurs. In this case, it is necessary
to turn off the power. This also applies when the programmable parameter input (GIO) function is used to rewrite the
parameter.

2) Always set undefined parameter numbers/bits to 0.

Reference point return procedure (Grid method)

Select manual continuous feed mode, and turn signal

ZRN on (connect it with + 24V). When feed towards

the reference point is designated with the manual feed

button, the moving part of the machine moves at rapid

traverse. When the deceleration limit switch is operated

and the contact of reference point return deceleration

signal *DCX, *DCY, *DCZ, *DC4 opens, and the feed is

decelerated.Thereafter, the moving part moves at a pre-

determined low speed.

Thereafter, when the deceleration limit switch is

operated and the moving part reaches the electric grid

position, feed stops, and reference point return

completion signal ZPX, ZPY, ZPZ, ZP4 is output. The

direction in which an axis is returned to reference point

can be set for each axis.

Once an axis is returned to reference point and the

corresponding signal ZPX, ZPY, ZPZ or ZP4 is output,

jog feed for that axis is invalid until signal ZRN is

turned off.

Set stroke limit mentioned above.

Setting range : 0 to 199999999 (unit: 0.001

mm in mm output or 0.0001 inch in inch

output)

Set with the distance from the reference

point.

In the case of diameter designation, set with

the diameter designation value.

The outside of the boundary set with the

parameter is set as the inhibited region.

Normally, set at the max. stroke of the

machine.

When the axis enters the inhibited region,

over-travel alarm is indicated. A margin

should be provided with respect to the stroke

to cope with the fluctuation in the detecting

operation. As a rule, in the case of metric

designation, multiply the rapid traverse by a

factor of l/5 and set it as the margin.

Example) Rapid traverse 10 m/min.

IO x l/5 = 2 mm

The actual position of the machine slightly

differs from the position stored in the CNC

unit after the power is turned on, emergency

stop is reset, or servo alarm is reset.

Therefore, before starting operation, be sure

to return the axes to reference point.

Otherwise, over-travel detecting position

deviates by the value corresponding to the

above-described deviation in the position.

When the parameters are set as follows, the

stroke limit becomes infinite.

Example) LTl  Zl = -1 and LTlZ2 = 1

(Note 1) For the axis whose stroke is infinite, the

incremental command can be specified. If the

absolute command is specified, the absolute

register may overflow and it is not operated

normally.
