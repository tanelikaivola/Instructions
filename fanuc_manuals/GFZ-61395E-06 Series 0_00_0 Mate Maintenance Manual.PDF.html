<p>B&ndash;61395E/06 SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
</p>
<p>s&ndash;3
</p>
<p>2 WARNINGS, CAUTIONS, AND NOTES RELATED TOCHECK OPERATION
WARNING
</p>
<p>1. When checking the operation of the machine with the cover removed
</p>
<p>(1) The user&rsquo;s clothing could become caught in the spindle or other components, thus
presenting a danger of injury.  When checking the operation, stand away from the machine
to ensure that your clothing does not become tangled in the spindle or other components.
</p>
<p>(2) When checking the operation, perform idle operation without workpiece.  When a
workpiece is mounted in the machine, a malfunction could cause the workpiece to be
dropped or destroy the tool tip, possibly scattering fragments throughout the area.  This
presents a serious danger of injury.  Therefore, stand in a safe location when checking the
operation.
</p>
<p>2. When checking the machine operation with the power magnetics cabinet door opened
</p>
<p>(1) The power magnetics cabinet has a high&ndash;voltage section (carrying a  mark).  Never
touch the high&ndash;voltage section.  The high&ndash;voltage section presents a severe risk of electric
shock.  Before starting any check of the operation, confirm that the cover is mounted on
the high&ndash;voltage section.  When the high&ndash;voltage section itself must be checked, note that
touching a terminal presents a severe danger of electric shock.
</p>
<p>(2) Within the power magnetics cabinet, internal units present potentially injurious corners and
projections.  Be careful when working inside the power magnetics cabinet.
</p>
<p>3. Never attempt to machine a workpiece without first checking the operation of the machine.
Before starting a production run, ensure that the machine is operating correctly by performing
a trial run using, for example, the single block, feedrate override, or machine lock function or
by operating the machine with neither a tool nor workpiece mounted.  Failure to confirm the
correct operation of the machine may result in the machine behaving unexpectedly, possibly
causing damage to the workpiece and/or machine itself, or injury to the user.
</p>
<p>4. Before operating the machine, thoroughly check the entered data.
Operating the machine with incorrectly specified data may result in the machine behaving
unexpectedly, possibly causing damage to the workpiece and/or machine itself, or injury to the
user.
</p>
<p>5. Ensure that the specified feedrate is appropriate for the intended operation.  Generally, for each
machine, there is a maximum allowable feedrate.  The appropriate feedrate varies with the
intended operation.  Refer to the manual provided with the machine to determine the maximum
allowable feedrate.  If a machine is run at other than the correct speed, it may behave
unexpectedly, possibly causing damage to the workpiece and/or machine itself, or injury to the
user.
</p>
<p>6. When using a tool compensation function, thoroughly check the direction and amount of
compensation.  Operating the machine with incorrectly specified data may result in the machine
behaving unexpectedly, possibly causing damage to the workpiece and/or machine itself, or
injury to the user.</p>

<p>SAFETY PRECAUTIONS B&ndash;61395E/06
</p>
<p>s&ndash;4
</p>
<p>3 WARNINGS AND NOTES RELATED TO REPLACEMENT
WARNING
</p>
<p>1. Always turn off the power to the CNC and the main power to the power magnetics cabinet.  If
only the power to the CNC is turned off, power may continue to be supplied to the serve section.
In such a case, replacing a unit may damage the unit, while also presenting a danger of electric
shock.
</p>
<p>2. When a heavy unit is to be replaced, the task must be undertaken by two persons.  If the
replacement is attempted  by only one person, the replacement unit could slip and fall, possibly
causing injury.
</p>
<p>3. After the power is turned off, the servo amplifier and spindle amplifier may retain voltages for
a while, such that there is a danger of electric shock even while the amplifier is turned off.  Allow
at least twenty minutes after turning off the power for these residual voltages to dissipate.
</p>
<p>4. When replacing a unit, ensure that the new unit has the same parameter and other settings as the
old unit.  (For details, refer to the manual provided with the machine.)  Otherwise, unpredictable
machine movement could damage the workpiece or the machine itself, and present a danger of
injury.</p>

</p>
<p>s&ndash;5
</p>
<p>4 WARNINGS AND NOTES RELATED TO PARAMETERS
WARNING
</p>
<p>1. When machining a workpiece for the first time after modifying a parameter, close the machine
cover.  Never use the automatic operation function immediately after such a modification.
Instead, confirm normal machine operation by using functions such as the single block function,
feedrate override function, and machine lock function, or by operating the machine without
mounting a tool and workpiece.  If the machine is used before confirming that it operates
normally, the machine may move unpredictably, possibly damaging the machine or workpiece,
and presenting a risk of injury.
</p>
<p>2. The CNC and PMC parameters are set to their optimal values, so that those parameters usually
need not be modified.  When a parameter must be modified for some reason, ensure that you
fully understand the function of that parameter before attempting to modify it.  If a parameter
is set incorrectly, the machine may move unpredictably, possibly damaging the machine or
workpiece, and presenting a risk of injury.</p>

</p>
<p>5 WARNINGS RELATED TO DAILY MAINTENANCE
WARNING
</p>
<p>1. Memory backup battery replacement
</p>
<p>When replacing the memory backup batteries, keep the power to the machine (CNC) turned on,
and apply an emergency stop to the machine.  Because this work is performed with the power
on and the cabinet open, only those personnel who have received approved safety and
maintenance training may perform this work.
When replacing the batteries, be careful not to touch the high&ndash;voltage circuits (marked  and
fitted with an insulating cover).
Touching the uncovered high&ndash;voltage circuits presents an extremely dangerous electric shock
hazard.
</p>
<p>NOTE
</p>
<p>The CNC uses batteries to preserve the contents of its memory, because it must retain data such as
programs, offsets, and parameters even while external power is not applied.
If the battery voltage drops, a low battery voltage alarm is displayed on the machine operator&rsquo;s panel
or CRT screen.
When a low battery voltage alarm is displayed, replace the batteries within a week.  Otherwise, the
contents of the CNC&rsquo;s memory will be lost.
To replace the battery, see the procedure described in Section 2.6 of this manual.</p>

<p>WARNING
</p>
<p>2. Absolute pulse coder battery replacement
</p>
<p>When replacing the memory backup batteries, keep the power to the machine (CNC) turned on,
and apply an emergency stop to the machine.  Because this work is performed with the power
on and the cabinet open, only those personnel who have received approved safety and
maintenance training may perform this work.
When replacing the batteries, be careful not to touch the high&ndash;voltage circuits (marked  and
fitted with an insulating cover).
Touching the uncovered high&ndash;voltage circuits presents an extremely dangerous electric shock
hazard.
</p>
<p>NOTE
</p>
<p>The absolute pulse coder uses batteries to preserve its absolute position.
If the battery voltage drops, a low battery voltage alarm is displayed on the machine operator&rsquo;s panel
or CRT screen.
When a low battery voltage alarm is displayed, replace the batteries within a week.  Otherwise, the
absolute position data held by the pulse coder will be lost.
To replace the battery, see the procedure described in Section 2.6 of this manual.</p>

<p>Similarly to the pulse coder, the manual pulse generator is designed to
operate on 5 VDC.  So, any voltage drop relative to the supply voltage
must be kept to within 0.2 V (total drop through the 0 V and 5 V lines).
Namely:
</p>
<p>0.2� 0.1� R� 2Lm
where 0.1 : Current required by the manual pulse generator
</p>
<p>R : Wire resistance per unit length [Ω/m]
m : Number of wires in the 0 V or 5 V cable
L : Cable length [m]

<p>� The SIN, *SIN and SOUT, *SOUT signals must be connected
by twisted pair cable.
</p>
<p>� Recommended cable: A66L&ndash;0001&ndash;0284#10P (single shield
twisted pair)
</p>
<p>� The cable shield should be clamped with a cable clamp to the
cabinet earth plate on the JD1A side.
</p>
<p>� Maximum cable length: 10m
</p>
<p>In cases where the FANUC I/O Link slave power supply selected is
neither the 24VDC supply used with the Series 0 nor the 200VAC Series
0 power supply input unit, then it is essential that the power be switched
on to all slave units before it is switched on to the Series 0.  In other words
the Series 0, which is in this case the master, must come last.
</p>
<p>If the power supply to any one of the slave units connected by the FANUC
I/O Link is cut off then all units connected by the I/O Link, including the
Series 0 itself, will assume abnormal status.  To restore normal operating
status all the units must be switched off and then started up again one by
one in the appropriate order.
</p>
<p>This section describes the servo interface between the Series 0 and the
digital control AC servo amplifier and servo motor.
</p>
<p>The Series 0 supports three types of axis control cards according to the
type of the pulse coder built into the servo motor or type of the servo
interface.
</p>
<p>For an explanation of each servo amplifier unit and servo motor, refer to
the relevant manual.
</p>
<p>� Axis control card for A/B&ndash;phase pulse coders (Type A interface)
</p>
<p>� Axis control card for serial pulse coders (Type A interface)
</p>
<p>� Axis control card for type B interface
</p>
<p>Axis control cards for serial pulse coders can also be connected to an
A/B&ndash;phase pulse coder.
</p>
<p>NOTE
In a closed loop system using a separate pulse coder, the
axis control cards for the A/B&ndash;phase pulse coders and those
for serial pulse coders use different connectors for their
feedback cables.

<p>NOTE
1 The total length of the cable between the CNC and amplifier
</p>
<p>and that between the amplifier and motor shall not exceed
50m.

<p>2 As the current feedback lines (IRn and ISn), use the middle
twisted pair of the recommended cable.  If any other pair is
used, abnormal noise or oscillation may occur.
</p>
<p>3 Use a servo unit which supports the type&ndash;B interface.  When
using a servo unit which supports both the type&ndash;A and
type&ndash;B interfaces, select the type&ndash;B interface.  For details,
refer to the manual supplied with the servo unit.  If the
interface setting is incorrect, a servo alarm (AL401 V
READY OFF) will be issued.</p>

<p>The user can select any of the supported axes as the axes to be controlled.
A cable for a servo amplifier or motor need not be connected to those axes
that are not to be used.  Leaving the connector for an unused axis open,
however, causes the CNC to enter a servo alarm state.  This section
describes how to handle (clamp) unused axes.
</p>
<p>NOTE
Servo parameters must also be set for clamped axes.  Set
the same servo parameters as those for any axis to be used.

<p>The power capacity of the CNC control unit, which in this section means
the specification required for the power supply, is obtained by adding the
power capacity of the control section and the power capacity of the servo
section.
The power capacity of the control section includes the power capacity of
the control unit, CRT/MDI, I/O unit, and operator&rsquo;s panel interface.
</p>
<p>Power capacity of the

<p>The CNC has been steadily reduced in size using surface&ndash;mount and
custom LSI technologies for electronic components. The CNC also is
designed to be protected from external noise.  However, it is difficult to
measure the level and frequency of noise quantitatively, and noise has
many uncertain factors.  Generally, noise is induced in the CNC due to
electrostatic coupling, electromagnetic induction, and ground loop.
The CNC is equipped with provisions to minimize the influence of
extraneous noise.  However, it is difficult to quantitatively measure the
strength of the noise and how often it occurs.  Besides, noise has many
unknown elements.  To maintain the stability of the CNC machine tool
system, it is important to minimize the occurrence of noise and prevent
it from being induced into the CNC.
When designing the power magnetics cabinet, guard against noise in the
machine as described in the following section.

<p>The AC/DC solenoid and relay are used in the power magnetics cabinet.
A high pulse voltage is caused by coil inductance when these devices are
turned on or off.
This pulse voltage induced through the cable causes the electronic circuits
to be disturbed.
</p>
<p>� Use a spark killer consisting of a resistor and capacitor in series.  This
type of spark killer is called a CR spark killer.(Use it under AC)
(A varistor is useful in clamping the peak voltage of the pulse
voltage, but cannot suppress the sudden rise of the pulse voltage.
FANUC therefore recommends a CR spark killer.)
</p>
<p>� The reference capacitance and resistance of the spark killer shall
conform to the following based on the current (I (A)) and DC

<p>The CNC cables that require shielding should be clamped by the method
shown below.  This cable clamp treatment is for both cable support and
proper grounding of the shield.  To insure stable CNC system operation,
follow this cable clamp method.
Partially peel out the sheath and expose the shield.  Push and clamp by
the plate metal fittings for clamp at the part.  The ground plate must be

</p>

</p>
<p>Part programs, offset data, and system parameters are stored in the CMOS
memory of the control unit.  Three &rdquo;D&rdquo;(R20) size alkaline batteries are
used to back up the memory of the control unit when the AC power source
is off.  These batteries are held in the battery unit.  The user is requested
to replace these batteries once a year.  When replacing the batteries, it is
necessary to keep the power supply switched on.  Note that if the batteries
are removed when the power supply is off, the contents (parameters and
programs) of memory will be lost.
</p>
<p>If the battery voltage drops, the warning message &rdquo;BAT&rdquo; appears on the
CRT screen, and a battery alarm signal is sent to the PMC.  If a battery
alarm occurs, replace the batteries as soon as possible (no later than within
one or two weeks).  Actually, however, the battery life depends on the
configuration of your system.
</p>
<p>If the battery voltage drops even further, it will become impossible to provide
memory backup.  If the power is switched on under this condition, a system
alarm (SRAM party alarm) occurs, because the contents of memory will
have been damaged.  Therefore, after replacing the batteries, it is necessary
to clear the entire contents of memory and re&ndash;enter the necessary programs
and data.  Keep the power switched on when replacing the batteries.  Do not
forget that disconnecting the memory backup batteries with the power
switched off will result in the total loss of the memory contents.
</p>
<p>Battery replacement method
</p>
<p>1 Obtain three new &rdquo;D&rdquo; (R20) size alkaline dry cells.
</p>
<p>2 Switch on the power to the control unit.
</p>
<p>3 Remove the battery case lid.
</p>
<p>4 Replace the batteries, observing the correct orientation.

<p>2. PA&ndash;PB signal (output) for keeping the power applied
In a system with no input unit in use, the PA&ndash;PB signal is a
contact signal used to keep the power applied.  It is output from
the power supply unit.  In a system with an input unit in use, the
PA&ndash;PB signal is used as an interface signal between the system
and input unit.  If the contact becomes open due to detection of
an abnormal output, the signal functions as an alarm signal.

<p>(3) Adjustments and settings
</p>
<p>This power supply unit requires no adjustment or setting.  Do not
attempt to adjust the reference voltage (=10.00V) at A10 unless
absolutely necessary, because the reference voltage has been adjusted
during unit test; merely confirm the voltage across A10 and A0 of
check connector CP16.
If the reference voltage at A10 falls outside the rated range, set it to
10.00V, using VR11, while measuring the voltage with a digital
voltmeter.  Rotating VR11 clockwise increases the voltage at A10.
After the power supply unit is replaced, always to check the reference
voltage at A10.
</p>
<p>(4) Causes of blown fuses and required corrective actions
</p>
<p>This power supply unit is provided with fuses F11 and F12 at its input,
fuse F13 at the +24V output, and fuse F14 at the +24E output.
Possible causes of these fuses blowing are listed below together with
the corrective actions required to restore normal operation.
</p>
<p>1. Fuses F11 and F12
</p>
<p>(a) Short circuit in surge absorber VS11
VS11 is intended to suppress surge voltages on the input line.
If an excessively large surge voltage or steady voltage is
applied to VS11, it breaks down, short&ndash;circuiting and,
causing F11 and F12 to blow.  If VS11 has short&ndash;circuited,
but you do not have a replacement part on hand, the machine
can be used with VS11 removed.  In such a case, however,
you should obtain a replacement and install it as soon as
possible, especially when the machine is being used in an
installation prone to surge voltages.  The specification
number of VS11 is A50L&ndash;8001&ndash;0067#431U.
</p>
<p>(b) Short circuit in diode stack DS11
</p>
<p>(c) Short circuit between the collector and emitter of switching
transistors Q14 and Q15</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>2. HARDWARE B&ndash;61395E/06
</p>
<p>116
</p>
<p>(d) Short circuit in diodes D33 and D34
</p>
<p>(e) Short circuit between the collector and emitter of transistor
Q1 in the auxiliary power supply circuit
</p>
<p>If you suspect that any of short circuits (b) to (e) has  occurred in
the respective parts, replace the power supply unit with a spare.
When replacing a fuse, use a replacement having the same rating.
The specification number for fuses F11 and 12 is
A60L&ndash;0001&ndash;0194#5.0.
</p>
<p>2. Fuse F13
(a) A short circuit may have occurred in the CRT/MDI unit or a
</p>
<p>+24 V power supply cord leading to it.  Remove the cord from
CP15, and check the unit and cord carefully.
</p>
<p>(b) A short circuit may have occurred in the +24 V circuit on the
master printed&ndash;circuit board.  Remove the cable from CP14
and CP15.  Also, remove the power supply unit from the
master printed&ndash;circuit board, then check the printed&ndash;circuit
board carefully.  When replacing a fuse, use a replacement
having the same rating.  The specification number for fuse
F13 is A60L&ndash;0001&ndash;0075#3.2.
</p>
<p>3. Fuse F14
(a) Short circuit in +24E power supply cables for various
</p>
<p>printed&ndash;circuit board units
</p>
<p>(b) Ground fault of the +24E power supply line in the machine
or false contact of the +24E power supply line with another
power supply line
</p>
<p>If either of (a) or (b) may have occurred, remove the cable from
CP14, and check it carefully.  When replacing a fuse, use a
replacement part having the same rating.  The specification
number for fuse F14 is A60L&ndash;0001&ndash;0046#5.0.</p>

<p>(3) Adjustments and settings
</p>
<p>This power supply unit requires no adjustment or setting.  Do not
attempt to adjust the reference voltage (=10.00V) at A10 unless
absolutely necessary, because the reference voltage has been adjusted
during unit test; merely confirm the voltage across A10 and A0 of
check connector CP16.
If the reference voltage at A10 falls outside the rated range, set it to
10.00V, using VR11, while measuring the voltage with a digital
voltmeter.  Rotating VR11 clockwise increases the voltage at A10.
After the power supply unit is replaced, always to check the reference
voltage at A10.
</p>
<p>(4) Causes of blown fuses and required corrective actions
</p>
<p>This power supply unit is provided with fuses F11 and F12 at its input,
fuse F13 at the +24 V output, and fuse F14 at the +24E output.
Possible causes of these fuses blowing are listed below together with
the corrective actions required to restore normal operation.
</p>
<p>1. Fuses F11 and F12
</p>
<p>(a) Short circuit in surge absorber VS11
VS11 is intended to suppress surge voltages on the input line.
If an excessively large surge voltage or steady voltage is
applied to VS11, it breaks down, short&ndash;circuiting and,
causing F11 and F12 to blow.  If VS11 has short&ndash;circuited,
but you do not have a replacement part on hand, the machine
can be used with VS11 removed.  In such a case, however,
you should obtain a replacement and install it as soon as
possible, especially when the machine is being used in an
installation prone to surge voltages.  The specification
number of VS11 is A50L&ndash;8001&ndash;0067#431U.
</p>
<p>(b) Short circuit in diode stack DS11
</p>
<p>(c) Short circuit between the collector and emitter of switching
transistors Q14 and Q15</p>

</p>
<p>(d) Short circuit in diodes D33 and D34
</p>
<p>(e) Short circuit between the collector and emitter of transistor

CP15, and check the unit and cord carefully.
</p>
<p>(b) A short circuit may have occurred in the +24 V circuit on the
master printed&ndash;circuit board.  Remove the cable from CP14
and CP15.  Also, remove the power supply unit from the
master printed&ndash;circuit board, then check the printed&ndash;circuit
board carefully.  When replacing a fuse, use a replacement
having the same rating.  The specification number for fuse
F13 is A60L&ndash;0001&ndash;0075#3.2.
</p>
<p>3. Fuse F14
(a) Short circuit in +24E power supply cables for various

<p>It is easy to mount and dismount the CNC power supply unit, because it
is designed to be mounted on, and connected directly to, the master
printed&ndash;circuit board.  All its AC inputs and DC outputs are linked via
connectors.
</p>
<p>Because this power supply unit has a built&ndash;in input unit function, it is not
necessary to prepare a separate relay or input unit for switching the AC
input on and off.  The AC input can be connected directly to the power
supply unit.  The unit has an AC service outlet, which is switched on and
off simultaneously with the power supply unit.  This AC service outlet can
be used to supply power to a unit such as a fan motor.

<p>(4) Causes of blown fuses and required corrective actions
</p>
<p>This power supply unit is provided with fuses F11 and F12 at its input,
fuse F13 at the +24V output, and fuse F14 at the +24E output.
Possible causes of these fuses blowing are listed below together with
the corrective actions required to restore normal operation.
</p>
<p>1. Fuses F11 and F12
</p>
<p>(a) Short circuit in surge absorber VS11
VS11 is intended to suppress surge voltages on the input line.
If an excessively large surge voltage or steady voltage is
applied to VS11, it breaks down, short&ndash;circuiting and,
causing F11 and F12 to blow.  If VS11 has short&ndash;circuited,
but you do not have a replacement part on hand, the machine
can be used with VS11 removed.  In such a case, however,
you should obtain a replacement and install it as soon as

installation prone to surge voltages.  The specification
number of VS11 is A50L&ndash;8001&ndash;0067#431U.
</p>
<p>(b) Short circuit in diode stack DS11
</p>
<p>(c) Short circuit between the collector and emitter of switching
transistors Q14 and Q15
</p>
<p>(d) Short circuit in diodes D33 and D34
</p>
<p>(e) Short circuit between the collector and emitter of transistor
Q1 in the auxiliary power supply circuit
</p>
<p>If you suspect that any of short circuits (b) to (e) has  occurred in
the respective parts, replace the power supply unit with a spare.
When replacing a fuse, use a replacement having the same rating.
The specification number for fuses F11 and 12 is
A60L&ndash;0001&ndash;0245#GP75.
</p>
<p>2. Fuse F13
(a) A short circuit may have occurred in the CRT/MDI unit or a
</p>
<p>+24 V power supply cord leading to it.  Remove the cord from
CP15, and check the unit and cord carefully.
</p>
<p>(b) A short circuit may have occurred in the +24 V circuit on the
master printed&ndash;circuit board.  Remove the cable from CP14
and CP15.  Also, remove the power supply unit from the
master printed&ndash;circuit board, then check the printed&ndash;circuit
board carefully.  When replacing a fuse, use a replacement
having the same rating.  The specification number for fuse
F13 is A60L&ndash;0001&ndash;0075#3.2.
</p>
<p>3. Fuse F14
(a) Short circuit in +24E power supply cables for various
</p>
<p>printed&ndash;circuit board units
</p>
<p>(b) Ground fault of the +24E power supply line in the machine
or false contact of the +24E power supply line with another
power supply line
</p>
<p>If either of (a) or (b) may have occurred, remove the cable from
CP14, and check it carefully.  When replacing a fuse, use a
replacement part having the same rating.  The specification

<p>2. HARDWARE B&ndash;61395E/06
</p>
<p>128
</p>
<p>4. Fuse F1
Fuse F1 and surge absorber VS1 are wired so that, if a high current
flows through VS1, it may cause F1 to blow.  This is intended to
protect the circuits in the power supply unit from an abnormal
voltage that may occur due to a failure in the auxiliary power
supply circuit of the power supply unit and an abnormal voltage
that may originate in the power supply ON/OFF switch contact
signal line or external alarm signal line.  If F1 blows, probable
causes are:
</p>
<p>(1) Failure in the auxiliary power supply circuit (M1, Q1, T1,
D1, Q2, or ZD1)
</p>
<p>(2) False contact between the power supply ON/OFF switch
contact signal line or external alarm signal line and the AC
power line
</p>
<p>If cause (1) is more likely, replace the power supply unit. If cause (2) is
more likely, replace the power supply unit, because the power supply
unit may have failed.  After the power supply ON/OFF switch contact
signal line and external alarm signal line have been checked, and all
abnormal conditions (if any) have been cleared, if replacing F1 restores
normal operation, there is no need to replace the power supply unit.  The
specification number of fuse F1 is A60L&ndash;0001&ndash;0172#DM03.  When
replacing the fuse, use a replacement having the same rating.</p>

<p>(4) Causes of blown fuses and required corrective actions
</p>
<p>This power supply unit is provided with fuses F1 at its input, fuse F3
at the +24V output, and fuse F4 at the +24E output.  Possible causes
of these fuses blowing are listed below together with the corrective
actions required to restore normal operation.
</p>
<p>1. Fuses F1
</p>
<p>(a) Short circuit in surge absorber VS11
VS11 is intended to suppress surge voltages on the input line.
If an excessively large surge voltage or steady voltage is
applied to VS11, it breaks down, short&ndash;circuiting and,
causing F1 to blow.  If VS11 has short&ndash;circuited, but you do
not have a replacement part on hand, the machine can be used
with VS11 removed.  In such a case, however, you should
obtain a replacement and install it as soon as possible,
especially when the machine is being used in an installation
prone to surge voltages.  The specification number of VS11
is A50L&ndash;2001&ndash;0122#G431K.
</p>
<p>(b) Short circuit in diode stack DB11
</p>
<p>(c) Short circuit between the collector and emitter of switching
transistors Q21 and Q22, Q11
</p>
<p>(d) Short circuit in diodes D12, D31, D32
</p>
<p>(e) Failure auxiliary power supply circuit IC (H1)
</p>
<p>(f) Failure in power&ndash;factor improvement IC (H3)
</p>
<p>(g) Failure in a unit connected to AC OUT (CP2 and CP3) or
short circuit in the wiring
</p>
<p>If you suspect that any of short circuits (b) to (e) has  occurred in
the respective parts, replace the power supply unit with a spare.
When replacing a fuse, use a replacement having the same rating.
The specification number for fuses F1 is A60L&ndash;0001&ndash;0245#GP75.
</p>
<p>2. Fuse F3
(a) A short circuit may have occurred in the CRT/MDI unit or a
</p>
<p>+24 V power supply cord leading to it.  Remove the cord from
CP5, and check the unit and cord carefully.
</p>
<p>(b) A short circuit may have occurred in the +24 V circuit on the
master printed&ndash;circuit board.  Remove the cable from CP5
and CP6.  Also, remove the power supply unit from the
master printed&ndash;circuit board, then check the printed&ndash;circuit
board carefully.  When replacing a fuse, use a replacement
having the same rating.  The specification number for fuse F3
is A60L&ndash;0001&ndash;0075#5.0.
</p>
<p>3. Fuse F4
(a) Short circuit in +24E power supply cables for various
</p>
<p>printed&ndash;circuit board units
</p>
<p>(b) Ground fault of the +24E power supply line in the machine
or false contact of the +24E power supply line with another
power supply line
</p>
<p>If either of (a) or (b) may have occurred, remove the cable from
CP6, and check it carefully.  When replacing a fuse, use a
replacement part having the same rating.  The specification
number for fuse F4 is A60L&ndash;0001&ndash;0046#5.0.</p>

This chapter describes the signals between the machine operator&rsquo;s panel,
magnetics cabinet and the PMC, connection of the signals between PMC
and CNC, and confirmation method of on/off state of these signals.
It also describes system configuration of PMC, parameters of PMC,
ladder and how to display time chart of the signals on the CRT.
It also describes a method of inputting/outputting PMC parameters to an
external device.

When plural reference marks are on a linear scale, a quotient of the
distance between the reference marks divided by an interfer may be
used as a reference counter capacity:

<p>Check the LED on the input unit or power supply unit AI.
</p>
<p>(1) If no power supply alarm is detected (the red &rdquo;ALM&rdquo; LED does not
light):
</p>
<p>1. If the PIL LED is off:
</p>
<p>(a) Check the input fuse of the input unit or power supply unit
AI. Measure the voltage across the R and S terminals on the
screw&ndash;on terminal strip of the input unit or at the connector
CP1 of the power supply unit AI using a
volt&ndash;ohm&ndash;milliammeter, and check whether 200 VAC is
available. If the 200 VAC cannot be detected at connector
CP1, check the corresponding circuit in the machine.
</p>
<p>(b) If both the fuse and power supply voltage are normal, the
printed&ndash;circuit board of the input unit or the power supply
unit AI may be defective.
</p>
<p>2. If the PIL LED lights, and the input voltage is normal:
Check whether the conditions for switching the power on are
satisfied.
</p>
<p>When power is turned on with the connector CP11 at the bottom of the
power supply unit detached, if a voltage of 200 VAC appears across pins
1 and 2 for about one second, it means that an ON condition is satisfied.

<p>(2) If a power supply alarm is detected (the red &rdquo;ALM&rdquo; LED lights):
</p>
<p>The most likely causes are a failure (short circuit or ground fault) or a
defective power supply unit.  Use the check procedure described below.
</p>
<p>NOTE
Do NOT detach the memory backup battery cable.
</p>
<p>1. Switch the power off, then check for a short circuit or ground fault
between the DC voltage check terminals (+5V, +15V, &ndash;15V,
+24V, and +24E) and the 0V point.
(Overcurrent)
If a short circuit or ground fault is detected, locate its cause by
unhooking the related connectors, one by one, and measuring the
resistance of each cable.
</p>
<p>2. If a short circuit is still detected after all related connectors have
been unhooked, remove the printed&ndash;circuit boards from the
control section, one by one, to determine whether any
printed&ndash;circuit board is short&ndash;circuited.
</p>
<p>3. If neither a short circuit nor a ground fault is detected, check
whether the input unit operates normally.  (This method is not
applicable to the power supply unit AI.)
(a) Remove the connector CP11 from the bottom of the power
</p>
<p>supply unit, and measure the voltage across pins 1 and 2.  If
200 VAC is output for about one second after the power on
button is pressed, at least half the input unit is normal.
</p>
<p>(b) With the connector CP11 detached, connect pins 5 and 6 with
a jumper wire, then turn on the power.  If 200 VAC is output
continuously, the input unit is normal.

<p>CNC is reading a dwell command (G04) in a program and is executing
the dwell command.
</p>
<p>Positioning (G00) to a specified position of a specified axis is not
completed.
Whether positioning is completed or not is checked as the servo position
error amount.  Check it CNC&rsquo;s diagnostic function as follows:
</p>
<p>DGN no.800 Position Error  &gt; PARAM 500 In&ndash;position width
</p>
<p>Position error amount almost becomes 0, when positioning of an axis
completes and when the amount becomes within the in&ndash;posiiton width,
it is assumed that positioning completes and the next block is exected.
If position error amount does not become within the in&ndash;position width,
refer to servo alarm 400, 4n0 and 4n1.

<p>Actual feedrate is overridden by the override signals to a programmed

<p>Absolute position data in the serial pulse coder was lost. 
(This alarm will be generated when serial pulse coder is exchanged or
position feedback signal cable of the serial pulse coder is disconnected).
</p>
<p>Machine position must be memorized using the following method:
</p>
<p>(1) Execute manual reference position return only for an axis for which
this alarm was generated.When manual reference position return
cannot be executed because of an another alarm, change parameter
0021 and release the alarm and perform manual operation.
</p>
<p>(2) Press RESET  key at the end of reference position return to release the
</p>
<p>alarm.
</p>
<p>Execute dogless reference position setting to memorize the reference
position.
</p>
<p>Since the reference position is different from the former one, change the
grid shift value (PRM No.508 to 511, 641, 642, 7508, 7509) to correct the
position.

</p>
<p>When a type&ndash;B axis board is being used with a built&ndash;in absolute pulse
coder and an α or β series amplifier, the battery is installed in the servo
amplifier.  In such a case, replace the battery as described in the
appropriate manual supplied with the servo amplifier.
</p>
<p>NOTE
1 When replacing the batteries for the � series servo amplifier
</p>
<p>module, keep the power to the servo amplifier switched on.
2 Note that we are not supposed to replace the batteries for
</p>
<p>the control unit (for memory backup).
</p>
<p>Procedure for replacing batteries for absolute pulse coder (separate type pulse coder)
</p>
<p>1 Prepare 4 alkaline batteries (UM&ndash;1type) commercially available in
advance.
</p>
<p>2 Turn machine (CNC) power ON.  (When replacing the batteries, keep
the power to the NC switched on.  If the batteries are replaced with the
power switched off, all data relating to the absolute position will be
lost.)
</p>
<p>3 Loosen screws on the battery case to remove the cover.  For placement
of the battery case, refer to the machine tool builder&rsquo;s manual.

<p>408 : Indicates that, in a system using serial spindles, the spindle 
amplifier does not start normally when power is applied.
</p>
<p>This alarm will not occur once the system (including the spindle control
unit) has started.  It can occur before the system starts during power
turn&ndash;on processing.  Once the system has started, an error is indicated as
system alarm 945.
</p>
<p>(1) The fiber optics cable is poorly connected, or the power to the spindle
amplifier is turned off.
</p>
<p>(2) An attempt was made to switch the NC power on when the spindle
amplifier display was SU&ndash;01 or any alarm condition other than
AL&ndash;24.
This condition occurs mainly if the NC power is switched off when
the serial spindles are running.  In this case, switch the power to the
spindle amplifier off then back on.
</p>
<p>(3) The hardware combination is invalid.
</p>
<p>(4) The second spindle is under any of conditions (1) to (3).

<p>This alarm indicates, to the CNC, that in a system with serial spindles, an
alarm has occurred in the spindle unit.
</p>
<p>The alarm is described using the AL&ndash;XX (where XX is a number) format
indicated on the spindle amplifier display.
</p>
<p>Setting bit 7 of parameter No. 0397 to 1 enables the display of the alarm
number from the spindle on the alarm screen.

<p>This alarm is intended to indicate a failure in the spindle control unit.  It
is detailed below.  The spindle should be repaired according to the
procedure described for each alarm.

<p>These alarms indicate RAM parity errors.
</p>
<p>RAM is provided with a check bit (parity bit).  When data is written to
RAM, the check bit is also written to the RAM by either setting it to 1 or
resetting it to 0 so that the total number of 1 bits in the data, including the
check bit, is even or odd.  When the data is read from RAM, the check bit
is used to ensure that the read data is correct.

</p>
<p>If a parity alarm still occurs after the RAM has been cleared to all 0s,
it is likely that the printed&ndash;circuit board on which the RAM in which the

</p>
<p>408 SPINDLE SERIAL LINK START
FAULT
</p>
<p>This alarm is generated when the spindle control unit is not ready for
starting correctly when the power is turned on in the system with the
serial spindle.
The four reasons can be considered as follows:
1) An improperly connected optic cable, or the spindle control unit&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>power is OFF.
2) When the NC power was turned on under alarm conditions other
</p>
<p>than SU&ndash;01 or AL&ndash;24 which are shown on the LED display of the
spindle control unit.
In this case, turn the spindle amplifier power off once and perform
startup again.
</p>
<p>3) Other reasons (improper combination of hardware)
This alarm does not occur after the system including the spindle con-
trol unit is activated.
</p>
<p>409 SPINDLE ALARM DETECTION A spindle amplifier alarm occurred in a system with a serial spindle.
The alarm is indicated as &rdquo;AL&ndash;XX&rdquo; (where XX is a number) on the
display of the spindle amplifier.  For details, see Maintenance Manual
for AC SPINDLE (Serial Interface) (B&ndash;65145E).  Setting bit 7 of pa-
rameter No. 0397 causes the spindle amplifier alarm number to ap-
pear on the screen.

C. CONNECTION OF CRT/MDI
</p>
<p>    UNIT FOR SERIES 00APPENDIX
</p>
<p>283
</p>
<p>The installation conditions and method for the CRT/MDI for the Series
00 are basically the same as in 9&Prime; CRT/MDI unis.  Therefore, refer to item
3 in the text.  Follow this reference material, however, for the following
items.
</p>
<p>This unit&rsquo;s heating value is about 170 W.  The pendant, etc. on which to
mount this unit should be designed as follows so that the inside
temperature does not rise more than 15�C above the outside temperature.
</p>
<p>1) Heat absorber
</p>
<p>The conventional 14&Prime; CRT/MDI unit heat absorber has insufficient
radiation.  A special heat absorber is available for this unit.  (It is a little
different from the conventional 14&Prime; CRT/MDI unit heat absorber in
size.)
</p>
<p>2) Air agitation fan in cabinet
</p>
<p>An air agitation fan (1) should be installed at the position shown in the
figure below so that air flows between the printed circuit boards at
0.5m/sec. (A special fan unit is available.)
