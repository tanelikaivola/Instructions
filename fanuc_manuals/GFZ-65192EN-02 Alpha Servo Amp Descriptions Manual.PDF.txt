2 WARNINGS AND CAUTIONS RELATING TO MOUNTING
WARNING

� Check the specification code of the amplifier.

Check that the delivered amplifier is as originally ordered.

� Mount a ground fault interrupter.

To guard against fire and electric shock, fit the factory power supply or machine with a ground
fault interrupter (designed for use with an inverter).

� Securely ground the amplifier.

Securely connect the ground terminal and metal frame of the amplifier and motor to a common
ground plate of the power magnetics cabinet.

� Be aware of the weight of the amplifier and other components.

Control motor amplifiers and AC reactors are heavy.  When transporting them or mounting them
in the cabinet, therefore, be careful not to injured yourself or damage the equipment.  Be
particularly carefull not to jam your fingers between the cabinet and amplifier.

� Never ground or short–circuit either the power supply lines or power lines.

Protect the lines from any stress such as bending.  Handle the ends appropriately.

� Ensure that the power supply lines, power lines, and signal lines are
securely connected.

A loose screw, loose connection, or the like will cause a motor malfunction or overheating, or
a ground fault.

� Insulate all exposed parts that are charged.

� Never touch the regenerative discharge resistor or radiator directly.

The surface of the radiator and regenerative discharge unit become extremely hot.  Never touch
them directly.  An appropriate structure should also be considered.

� Close the amplifier cover after completing the wiring.

Leaving the cover open presents a danger of electric shock.



SAFETY PRECAUTIONS B–65192EN/02

s–4

CAUTION

� Do not step or sit on the amplifier.

Also, do not stack unpacked amplifiers on top of each other.

� Use the amplifier in an appropriate environment.

See the allowable ambient temperatures and other requirements, given in the corresponding
descriptions.

� Protect the amplifier from corrosive or conductive mist or drops of water.

Use a filter if necessary.

� Protect the amplifier from impact.

Do not place anything on the amplifier.

� Do not disassemble the amplifier.

� Do not block the air inlet to the radiator.

A deposit of coolant, oil mist, or chips on the air inlet will result in a reduction in the cooling
efficiency.  In some cases, the required efficiency cannot be achieved.  The deposit may also lead
to a reduction in the useful life of the semiconductors.  Especially, when outside air is drawn in,
mount filters on both the air inlet and outlet.  These filters must be replaced regularly.  So, an
easy–to–replace type of filter should be used.

� Connect the power supply lines and power lines to the appropriate
terminals.

� Connect the signal lines to the appropriate connectors.

� Ensure that the cables used for the power supply lines and power lines are
of the appropriate diameter and temperature ratings.

� Do not apply an excessively large force to plastic parts.

If a plastic section breaks, it may cause internal damage, thus interfering with normal operation.
The edge of a broken section is likely to be sharp and, therefore, presents a risk of injury.

� Before connecting the power supply wiring, check the supply voltage.

Check that the supply voltage is within the range specified in this manual, then connect the power
supply lines.



B–65192EN/02 SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

s–5

CAUTION

� Ensure that the combination of motor and amplifier is appropriate.

� Ensure that valid parameters are specified.

Specifying an invalid parameter for the combination of motor and amplifier may not only
prevent normal operation of the motor but also result in damage to the amplifier.

� Ensure that the amplifier and peripheral equipment are securely
connected.

Check that the magnetic contactor, circuit breaker, and other devices mounted outside the
amplifier are securely connected to each other and that those devices are securely connected to
the amplifier.

� Check that the amplifier is securely mounted in the power magnetics
cabinet.

If any clearance is left between the power magnetics cabinet and the surface on which the
amplifier is mounted, dust entering the gap may build up and prevent the normal operation of
the amplifier.

� Apply appropriate countermeasures against noise.

Adequate countermeasures against noise are required to maintain normal operation of the
amplifier.  For example, signal lines must be routed away from power supply lines and power
lines.

magnetics cabinet and amplifier, as well as the power lines and power
supply lines, are securely connected.  Also, check that no lines are slack.

� Before turning on the power, ensure that the power magnetics cabinet is
securely grounded.

� Before turning on the power, check that the door of the power magnetics
cabinet and all other doors are closed.

Ensure that the door of the power magnetics cabinet containing the amplifier, and all other doors,
are securely closed.  During operation, all doors must be closed and locked.

� Apply extreme caution if the door of the power magnetics cabinet or
another door must be opened.

Only a person trained in the maintenance of the corresponding machine or equipment should
open the door, and only after shutting off the power supply to the power magnetics cabinet (by
opening both the input circuit breaker of the power magnetics cabinet and the factory switch used
to supply power to the cabinet).  If the machine must be operated with the door open to enable
adjustment or for some other purpose, the operator must keep his or her hands and tools well
away from any dangerous voltages.  Such work must be done only by a person trained in the
maintenance of the machine or equipment.

� When operating the machine for the first time, check that the machine
operates as instructed.

To check whether the machine operates as instructed, first specify a small value for the motor,
then increase the value gradually.  If the motor operates abnormally, perform an emergency stop
immediately.

� After turning on the power, check the operation of the emergency stop
circuit.

Press the emergency stop button to check that the motor stops immediately, and that the power
being supplied to the amplifier is shut off by the magnetic contactor.

� Before opening a door or protective cover of a machine to enable
adjustment of the machine, first place the machine in the emergency stop
state and check that the motor has stopped.



SAFETY PRECAUTIONS B–65192EN/02

s–8

CAUTION

� Note whether an alarm status relative to the amplifier is displayed at
power–up or during operation.

If an alarm is displayed, take appropriate action as explained in the maintenance manual.  If the
work to be done requires that the door of the power magnetics cabinet be left open, the work must
be carried out by a person trained in the maintenance of the machine or equipment.  Note that
if some alarms are forcibly reset to enable operation to continue, the amplifier may be damaged.
Take appropriate action according to the contents of the alarm.

� Before operating the motor for the first time, mount and adjust the position
and speed detectors.

Following the instructions given in the maintenance manual, adjust the position and speed
detectors for the spindle so that an appropriate waveform is obtained.  If the detectors are not
properly adjusted, the motor may not rotate normally or the spindle may fail to stop as desired.

� If the motor makes any abnormal noise or vibration while operating, stop
it immediately.

Note that if operation is continued in spite of there being some abnormal noise or vibration, the
amplifier may be damaged.  Take appropriate corrective action, then resume operation.

� Observe the ambient temperature and output rating requirements.

The continuous output rating or continuous operation period of some amplifiers may fall as the
ambient temperature increases.  If the amplifier is used continuously with an excessive load
applied, the amplifier may be damaged.

4 WARNINGS AND CAUTIONS RELATING TO MAINTENANCE
WARNING

� Read the maintenance manual carefully and ensure that you are totally
familiar with its contents.
The maintenance manual describes daily maintenance and the procedures to be followed in the
event of an alarm being issued.  The operator must be familiar with these descriptions.

� Notes on replacing a fuse or PC board

1) Before starting the replacement work, ensure that the circuit breaker protecting the power
magnetics cabinet is open.

2) Check that the red LED that indicates that charging is in progress is not lit.  The position
of the charging LED on each model of amplifier is given in this manual.  While the LED
is lit, hazardous voltages are present inside the unit, and thus there is a danger of electric
shock.

3) Some PC board components become extremely hot.  Be careful not to touch these
components.

4) Ensure that a fuse having an appropriate rating is used.

5) Check the specification code of a PC board to be replaced.  If a modification drawing number
is indicated, contact FANUC before replacing the PC board.  Also, before and after replacing
a PC board, check its pin settings.

6) After replacing the fuse, ensure that the screws are firmly tightened.  For a socket–type fuse,
ensure that the fuse is inserted correctly.

7) After replacing the PC board, ensure that it is securely connected.

8) Ensure that all power lines, power supply lines, and connectors are securely connected.

� Take care not to lose any screws.
When removing the case or PC board, take care not to lose any screws.  If a screw is lost inside
the nit and the power is turned on, the machine may be damaged.

� Notes on replacing the battery of the absolute pulse coder
Replace the battery only while the power is on.  If the battery is replaced while the power is turned
off, the stored absolute positioning data will be lost.  Some   series servo amplifier modules have
batteries in their servo amplifiers.  To replace the battery of any of those models, observe the
following procedure:  Open the door of the power magnetics cabinet; Leave the control power
of the power supply module on; Place the machine in the emergency stop state so that the power
being input to the amplifier is shut off; Then, replace the battery.  Replacement work should be
done only by a person who is trained in the related maintenance and safety requirements.  The
power magnetics cabinet in which the servo amplifier is mounted has a high–voltage section.
This section presents a severe risk of electric shock.



SAFETY PRECAUTIONS B–65192EN/02

s–10

WARNING

� Check the number of any alarm.

If the machine stops upon an alarm being issued, check the alarm number.  Some alarms indicate
that a component must be replaced.  If the power is reconnected without first replacing the failed
component, another component may be damaged, making it difficult to locate the original cause
of the alarm.

� Before resetting an alarm, ensure that the original cause of the alarm has
been removed.

� Contact FANUC whenever a question relating to maintenance arises.



B–65192EN/02 SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

s–11

CAUTION

� Ensure that all required components are mounted.

When replacing a component or PC board, check that all components, including the snubber
capacitor, are correctly mounted.  If the snubber capacitor is not mounted, for example, the IPM
will be damaged.

� Tighten all screws firmly.

� Check the specification code of the fuse, PC board, and other
components.

When replacing a fuse or PC board, first check the specification code of the fuse or PC board,
then mount it in the correct position.  The machine will not operate normally if a fuse or PC board
having other than the correct specification code  is mounted, or if a fuse or PC board is mounted
in the wrong position.

� Mount the correct cover.

The cover on the front of the amplifier carries a label indicating a specification code.  When
mounting a previously removed front cover, take care to mount it on the unit from which it was
removed.

� Notes on cleaning the heat sink and fan

1) A dirty heat sink or fan results in reduced semiconductor cooling efficiency, which degrades
reliability.  Periodic cleaning is necessary.

2) Using compressed air for cleaning scatters the dust.  A deposit of conductive dust on the
amplifier or peripheral equipment will result in a failure.

3) To clean the heat sink, do so only after turning the power off and ensuring that the heat sink
has cooled to room temperature.  The heat sink becomes extremely hot, such that touching
it during operation or immediately after power–off is likely to cause a burn.  Be extremely
careful when touching the heat sink.

� Notes on removing the amplifier

Before removing the amplifier, first ensure that the power is shut off.  Be careful not to jam your
fingers between the power magnetics cabinet and amplifier.



SAFETY PRECAUTIONS B–65192EN/02

s–12

NOTE

� Ensure that the battery connector is correctly inserted.

If the power is shut off while the battery connector is not connected correctly, the absolute
position data for the machine will be lost.

� Store the manuals in a safe place.

The manuals should be stored in a location where they can be accessed immediately it so required
during maintenance work.

� Notes on contacting FANUC

Inform FANUC of the details of an alarm and the specification code of the amplifier so that any
components required for maintenance can be quickly secured, and any other necessary action
can be taken without delay.

1 OVERVIEW
This FANUC α series control motor amplifier unit (svu/svuc) is suitable
for systems with one or two feed axes.
The features of the servo amplifier unit are as follows:

The servo amplifier unit is integrated with a power supply.
It enables implementation of a compact system with one or two feed axes.

SVU: The servo amplifier unit is designed to comply with the VDE
0160 (Europe), UL (USA), and CSA (Canada) safety standards.

SVUC: The servo amplifier unit is designed to comply with UL (USA)
and CSA (Canada) safety standards. It does not conform to VDE
0160 (Europe) safety standards.

The servo amplifier unit provides a new interface (type B) as well as the
conventional interface (type A) for the CNC.

The servo amplifier unit uses an up–to–date power device, IPM
(intelligent power module), to reduce power loss and enhance alarm
detection, thereby increasing its reliability.

To maintain compatibility, the servo amplifier unit has the same external
shape as the C series amplifier.  In addition, they can be mounted in the
same manner. 
(Some specifications are different, however.  See Chapter 10 for details.)

CAUTION
1 Be sure to use an AC line filter in order to reduce harmonic

interference with the power supply. See Section 4.1 for
details .If a power supply transformer (insulation type) is
used for the line voltage out of specification, it can dispense
with an AC line filter. If the AC line filter is ineffective in
satisfying the EMC standards, use a commercial noise filter.

2 If the line voltage is higher than 200/220/230 VAC, use a
power transformer. When a transformer is used, an AC line
filter usually becomes unnecessary, however in the case
that requirements of EMC standard are still not satisfied, AC
line filter will be needed.

3 If the load inertia or the frequency of acceleration/
deceleration is high, and the regenerative discharge energy
from the motor exceeds a specified value, separate
regenerative discharge unit should be used. If the heat
dissipation is higher than a specified value of a separate
regenerative discharge unit, please check the servo motor
selection and consult FANUC. See Section 4.2 for details.

NOTE
1 This amplifier has two types of NC interfaces. Type A

interface requires JV (1/2) B. Type B interface requires JS
(1/2) B or JF (1/2) .

2 The specification of the spare fuses is common to both the
control power supply and fanmotors. A fanmotor fuse is built
only in SVU1–130 (A06B–6089–H106) and SVUC1–130
(A06B–6090–H008).

3 SVU1–130 (A06B–6089–H106), SVUC1–130
(A06B–6090–H008) and a separate regenerative
discharge unit (A06B–6089–H711 to –H714) with a cooling
fan contains a fanmotor. A fanmotor should be arranged as
a spare part.

4 Use the following servo amplifiers for the T series motors
(hollow–type motors) .
Model 0T/3000  => Amplifier corresponding to α3/3000
Model 5T/2000  => Amplifier corresponding to α6/2000

 An AC line filter should be used to reduce the effect of harmonic noise
to the power supply.  If two or more servo amplifiers are connected to one
AC line filter, the total continuous output rating of all the connected servo
amplifiers should be kept below the continuous output rating of the AC
line filter.

Estimation of total continuous output rating of the servo motors can be
reduced depending on the load conditions.

(1) If a servo motor releases a large amount of regenerative discharge,
which exceeds the regenerative discharge capacity of the regenerative
discharge resistor in the servo amplifier, it is necessary to use a
separate regenerative discharge unit.

(2) If the motor regenerative discharge R calculated in Subsec. 4.2.1 for
each axis exceeds the regenerative discharge capacity of the
regenerative discharge resistor in the servo amplifier listed in Table
4.2.2 (a) , use a separate regenerative discharge unit.  If R exceeds also
the regenerative discharge capacity of the regenerative discharge
resistor in the separate regenerative discharge unit listed in Table
4.2.2 (b) , contact FANUC and ask for information.  (If a machine has
a high holding torques on its vertical axis with no counter balance, a
large amount of high regenerative discharge occurs when the load
moves down along the vertical axis.  In such a case, especially if the
machine has a long stroke and the load descends rapidly, the amount
of generated regenerative discharge may exceed the regenerative
discharge capacity of the separate regenerative discharge unit. )

(3) The regenerative discharge capacity of the regenerative discharge
resistor in the following units can be increased by cooling the resistor
with an external cooling fan:  separate regenerative discharge units
A06B–6089–H510 and H500, and servo amplifiers (A06B–6089–
H104, H105, and H201 to H210) and (A06B–6090–H004, H006, and
H222 to H266). 
 Tables 4.2.2 (a) and (b) list the relationships between the speed of
cooling air flow and the regenerative discharge capacity.

(4) The separate regenerative discharge units listed in Table 4.2.2 (b) have been
developed for use with the α series servo amplifier units. These discharge
units comply with European safety standards (VDE 0160). The separate
regenerative discharge units for the C series servo amplifier units can
be used for the α series servo amplifier units. However they have not
been designed to meet the requirements of the European standards.

Cautions in connecting the power supply

The servo amplifier requires a three–phase input for power and a single–
phase input for control power. Two lines of the three–phase input for power
were connected with the lines of the single–phase input for control power
by a jumper bar on terminal board T1 at the factory.
If you want to separate the two power supplies, remove the jumper bar.

(1) If more than one servo motor is used, the total power requirement can
be calculated by adding the requirements of all the servo motors.

(2) As for continuous output ratings, the power requirements listed in
Table 5.2.1 are sufficient. However, when a servo motor is required
to accelerate sharply, it may momentarily consumes power twice as
more as the continuous output rating.
So, check the amplifier input voltage during simultaneous
acceleration/deceleration of the servo motors. The voltage should be
at least 170 VAC (200 VAC –15%).

Select a transformer according to the load condition and the model of the
motor for which the transformer is used. Each transformer has secondary
winding taps for three amplifiers so that it can be connected to two or three
amplifiers.

For a machine with typical operating conditions, select a transformer
according to the following guideline.

 (Sum of 3–phase power requirements of all motors) � 0.6 � transformer rating

Table 5.2.1 Table 5.3.1

CAUTION
When two or more motors are used, the transformer rating
obtained using the above expression may be less than the
actual power requirements of any one of those motors.
Should this occur, use the motors’ maximum power
requirements as the transformer rating.

(Example) The power requirements of the α22/2000 and
α40/2000 (with fan) are indicated in Table 5.2.1, as shown
below:

α22/2000 : 5.9 kVA
α40/2000 (with fan) : 11.3 kVA

Using the expression given above, the transformer rating is
calculated as follows:

(5.9 + 11.3)*0.6 = 10.32 kVA

The power requirement of the α40/2000 (with fan) is 11.3
kVA, this being greater than the calculated transformer
rating of 10.32 kVA. So, the transformer rating should be
11.3 kVA.

6 HEAT GENERATION
(1) The heat generated by a servo amplifier unit can be calculated by the

following equations.   In calculation,  use appropriate values selected
from Tables 6.1 and 6.2 according to the models of the amplifier and
motor to be used.

Value determined depending on the motor for the second axis
Value determined depending on the motor for the first axis
Value determined depending on the unit

Total heat generation (W)  = a + (c+d) + (c+d)  

Heat generated in the cabinet (W)  = b + (0.2c+d) + (0.2c+d)
 (cooling by natural air flow)  
 

Heat generated in the cabinet (W)  = b + (0.1c+d) + (0.1c+d)
 (cooling by forced air flow) 
 

(Example) When the SVU2–20/40 is used to drive the
C12/2000 and  C22/1500, the generated heat is calculated
as follows: 

Each heat generation SVU2–20/40 a=29.8  b=29.8
αC12/2000  c=27.3  d=3.8
αC22/1500  c=53.0  d=8.6

Total heat generation= 
29.8 + (27.3+3.8) + (53.0+8.6) = 122.5

Heat generated in the cabinet = 
29.8 + (0.2�27.3+3.8) + (0.2�53.0+8.6) = 58.3 

(cooling by natural air flow) 
Heat generated in the cabinet = 

29.8 + (0.1�27.3+3.8) + (0.1�53.0+8.6) = 50.2 
(cooling by forced air flow)

(2) The amounts of generated heat listed above apply when all motors run
at the respective continuous output ratings.   These values may be
decreased during cabinet design,  depending on the actual operating
condition.

(3) The servo amplifier heat sinks can be placed outside the cabinet
(except for some models). This configuration can reduce the heat
generated within the cabinet. The amount of heat generated in the
cabinet varies depending on whether the heat sink is cooled by natural
or forced air flow.



B–65192EN/02 6. HEAT GENERATION

33

CAUTION
Cooling by forced air flow uses a air flow speed of 2 m/s
measured at the heat sink. Servo amplifier unit A06B–6089
–H106 or A06B–6090–H008 has a standard built–in cooling
fan.

(4) Heat generated by the regenerative discharge resistor

· The regenerative discharge resistor built in servo amplifier
A06B–6089–H101/H102 or A06B–6090–H002/H003 cannot be
placed outside the cabinet because of its structure.
Therefore,  the amount of heat generated in the resistor must be added
to the total heat generated in the cabinet. See Section 4.2 for
descriptions of the heat generated by the regenerative discharge
resistor.
 

· The regenerative discharge resistor built in a servo amplifier other than
A06B–6089–H101/H102 or A06B–6090–H002/H003 can be placed
outside the cabinet by putting its heatsink out of the cabinet. In this
case,  it is unnecessary to add the heat generated by the regenerative
discharge resistor to the total heat generated in the cabinet. 

· If a separate regenerative discharge resistor unit is placed outside the
cabinet,  it is unnecessary to add the heat generated by the regenerative
discharge resistor to the total heat generated in the cabinet. 

· If the heat sink of a servo amplifier unit or a separate regenerative
discharge resistor unit is in the cabinet,  it is necessary to add the heat
generated by the regenerative discharge resistor to the total heat
generated in the cabinet. See Section 4.2 for descriptions of the heat
generated by the regenerative discharge resistor.

The servo amplifier unit is designed for installation in the machine
magnetics cabinet with the heat sink protruding from the rear of the
cabinet so that the heat generated in the semiconductors is released
outside the cabinet to minimize the heat remaining in the cabinet. So,
observe the following items when installing the servo amplifier unit.

(1) Be careful not allow dielectric fluid,  oil mist,  or cutting chips to
attach to the heat sink or fan. Such foreign matter may decrease the
cooling effeciency and prevent the normal operation of the servo
amplifier unit.
In addition,  the life of the semiconductors in the amplifier may be
adversely affected. If the machine magnetics cabinet is designed to
take in outside air,  use an air filter at the air inlet.   Also seal the cable
access holes and door of the cabinet securely.

(2) Protect the main body of the servo amplifier unit from contaminants
(such as dust, coolant, organic solvent, acid, corrosive gas, and salt)  by
keeping it in a cabinet. When it is used in an environment where it may be
exposed to radiations (such as microwave, ultraviolet ray, laser beam, and
X–ray), take a necessary provision to shut out the radiations.

(3) Keep dust or dielectric fluid from entering an air outlet without
disturbing the cooling air flow.

(4) Take precautions to facilitate inspection, dismounting, and mounting
of the servo amplifier unit for maintenance.

(5) Separate the current carrying lines from the signal lines, and take
measures for noise. For details, see Section 7.3 and refer to the
appropriate CNC connection manual.

Cautions for
Installation



B–65192EN/02

7. INSTALLATION CONDITIONS
    AND CAUTIONS

37

Because the α series control motor amplifiers drive motors using a
transistor PWM inverter, high–frequency current leaks to a ground line
through a stray capacitance between the motor winding,  power cable, or
amplifier and the ground line. This current may cause a ground fault
interrupter or leakage protection relay to malfunction. To prevent such a
malfunction,  use a ground fault interrupter designed for use with an
inverter. The values listed in the following table indicate the approximate
leakage current of each motor.

NOTE
Wire material of cable K1
Recommended material of cable K1 is as follows.

Specification : A66L–001–0284#10P
Name : 10 pairs cable
Material : #28AWG�10 pairs (20 cores), Standard Length is 

 200m
Maker : Hitachi Cable , Oki Electric Cable

 (Important points)

(1) Assign the current feedback signal (IRn, ISn,  pairs of wires are 1–2,
11–12) in the center of the cable to protect from the effect of the noise.
Otherwise, the motor may move abnormally.
Use pair of wires 5–6 in the case of Hitachi Cable, and 6–7 in the case
of Oki Electric Cable.

(2) The cables are totally shielded. The shield should be ground to the
earth plate near the NC



B–65192EN/02 9. CONNECTION

(3) Associate ten twisted–pair wires with paires of pins 1 and 2,  3 and
4, . . . , and 19 and 20 of a connector such as PCR–E20FA when
connecting the pins with the pairs.

Important point
When the motor do not ground to the machine (cabinet)  that
the motor is mounted, connect the ground of motor and the
ground of amplifier with the cable to absorb the noise. In this
case, use the cable thicker than 1.25mm2 which is not the
line inside the power cable, and install aloof from power
cable as possible.
By this connection, the influence of the switching noise can
be reduced.

(2) Cautions

CAUTION
1 Minimize the length of wiring indicated in solid line so as to

enhance the lightning surge absorptive effect.
� Wire cross–sectional area :  

2 mm2 or more
� Wire length : 

The total length of the cable used for lightning surge 
protector 1 (a) and that used for lightning surge protector
2 (a) must not exceed 2 m.

2 When a dielectric strength test is conducted with an
overvoltage  (1000 or 1500 VAC) applied to the power line,
previously remove the lightning surge protector 2;
otherwise, it will operates on the supplied voltage.

3 The circuit protector  (5A)  is intended to protect the line if
a lightning surge protector is short–circuited and fails to
operate because of a surge voltage higher than its tolerance
being applied.

4 Because usually no current flows through the lightning
surge protectors 1 and 2,  they can share the circuit
protector  (5A)  with other equipment. 
The circuit protector can be connected to the SVU control
power supply and the fan motor power supply for the
separate regenerative discharge unit.

Monitoring contacts RL1 and RL2, or RL2 and RL3, are used as the direct
output of the auxiliary contact of a contactor or relay for a dynamic brake.
Machine tool builders can use these contacts when designing a safety
device or the like. The contacts correspond to MC1 and MC2 of a C series
amplifier. The output from the contacts of some models differs from that
of the C series amplifier.

� Surge absorber

SVU: Does not have a built–in surge absorber, so as to conform to
European standards. An external surge absorber is required.
For details, see Subsec. 9.3.13.

SVUC: Contains a surge absorber in the same way as the C series
amplifier. An external surge absorber is not required.

� The specifications of the monitoring contact have been partly
modified.

The monitoring contacts of the C series amplifier provide the output
for the auxiliary contact of the magnetic contactor used to shut off the
main circuit. The monitoring contacts of the SVU/SVUC provide the
output for the auxiliary contact of a DB relay or contactor. For details,
see Subsec. 9.3.15.

NOTE
For details of the SVU/SVUC connectors, see Subsec.

� Power shut–off

The C series amplifier shuts off all three phases of the input by means
of the internal magnetic contactor. The SVU/SVUC, however, shuts
off only two phases using the internal power relay. This two–phase
shut–off enables effective shut–off of the power. If three–phase
shut–off (complete separation of the potential) is necessary, use an
externally mounted MCC.

NOTE
To gain approval to affix the CE marking (machinery
directive), an external MCC satisfying European safety
requirements is necessary. For details, see Subsec. 9.1.2.

(1) Switch setting
Some switches have been added on the front of the amplifier. The
following switches must be set:
– Interface setting (SW1)
– SVU/SVUC mode setting (SW2)
– Protection setting for regenerative discharge resistor (SW3, SW4)
Set these switches as described in Section 3.4.

(2) MCC monitoring contact output
The conventional b–contact output has been changed to the a–contact
output in the case of the SVUC1–130 only. For details, see Subsec.
9.3.15.

(3) Cable and connector
The connector names of the � series are the same as those of the NC,
but different from those of the C series amplifier. JV1B and JV2B of
the SVUC correspond to CN1(L) and CN1M of the C series amplifier.

(4) Maintenance fuse
The maintenance fuse of the C series amplifier cannot be used with
the SVUC because of a difference in ratings. As the SVUC

A06B–6089–H*** has been modified from A06B–6066–H*** such
that it complies with VDE 0160.  Their specifications (characteristics
and external dimensions) are, however, the same.  A06B–6066–H***
can, therefore, be used in place of A06B–6089–H***.

NOTE
A06B–6066–H*** does not comply with VDE 0160.
