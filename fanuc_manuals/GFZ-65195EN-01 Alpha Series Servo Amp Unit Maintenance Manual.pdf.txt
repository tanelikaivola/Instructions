Notes
1 This circuit breaker is intended to protect the power cord and related equipment. A circuit

breaker to protect a servo amplifier unit is provided within the servo amplifier unit.
2 This AC line filter should always be used,so influence by harmonic noise to the power supply

can be reduced.  When the line voltage is out of specification,and a power transformer (isolation
type) is used, the AC line filter can be omitted. 
If the AC line filter is ineffective in making the servo amplifier unit satisfy EMC standards, use
an appropriate commercial noise filter.

3 The magnetic contactor is required if it is necessary to qualify for European CE marking.
4 When using the SVU,install a surge absorber between the power lines and between a power

line and a ground line at the entrance of the power magnetic cabinet in order to protect the
equipment from a surge voltage.  For the SVUC, it is unnecessary to install an external surge
absorber because the SVUC has a built- in surge absorber as the C series amplifier.

(2) Power requirements
• The power requirement of the servo amplifier unit is the sum of the

power requirements of individual servo motors.
• When  servo motor accelertes or decelertes rapidly, it may require

power twice as much as the continuous rating momentarily.  Check on
the input voltage required when more than one servo motor accelertes
or decelertes simultaneously, and keep the voltage above 170 VAC.

• Refer to Chapter 5 of “SERVO AMPLIFIER UNIT Descriptions”
(B-65192EN) for details of the power requirements.

(3) When motor power and control power are input separately from each
other.  When supplying motor power and control power separately
from each other, be sure to remove a jumper connecting L1C and L1,
and a jumper connecting L2C and L2.  (These jumpers have been
factory-insatlled.)

When it is necessary to make a motor operating with the SVU qualify for
European CE marking, ground the motor using the accessory plate
terminal.

Note that installing more than one protection ground line with  single
screw makes it impossible for the motor to qualify for European CE
marking. (See Appendix NO TAG.)

Because the drive circuit for the servo amplifier unit operates by  pulse
width modulation control system using IGBTs, high-frequency leakage
current flows from the motor windings and power lines to the ground
through stray capacitance.  This leakage current may cause the ground
fault interrupter or leakage protection relay installed in the power line on
the power supply side to malfunction.  So they must have a maesure
against influence from inverters so tht they do not malfunction.

The voltage across the 0V and +5V check pins should be 5V +5%.

The motor instantaneous current can be measured by observing the
voltage across the 0V and IRL, IRM, ISL, or ISM check pins on an
oscilloscope.  This measurement cannot be done correctly with a
volt-ohm-milliammeter.
The relationships between the motor instantaneous current and the
measured voltage are as described below.  The servo amplifier name has
a number enclosed in a box “�”.  This number is a limit to the motor
instantaneous current. It is determined so that when the motor current
reaches the limit,the measured voltage is �4V.
Therefore, the coefficient to calculate the motor current is obtained as
follows.

(5) VCMD signal
The VCMD signal is used to output a speed command.  It can also be
used to measure a very small vibration or uneven movement of the
motor.  The VCMD signal conversion mode can be switched by a
parameter.  Because the VCMD signal is clamped at +5 V, the
waveform may become difficult to observe.  In such a case, switch for
easier observation.

When the signal conversion result for the VCMD waveform is W (rpm/5
V), the voltage per positional shift pulse is:

Voltage (V) per positional deviation pulse =
300 _ Position gain (S–1)

Number of positional feedback pulses/motor revolution _ W

(Example)
Assume the conditions:  Position gain = 30 (S–1), the number of positional
feedback pulses/motor revolution = 1000 pulses, and signal conversion
result for the VCMD waveform = 14 rpm/5 V with 1 µm/pulse)

Under these conditions, if you observe E = 300 mV and 1/f = 20 ms:
Voltage per positional deviation pulse = 64 mv/pulse
Therefore, table vibration = 300 _ 1/64 = 4.6 µm, with a vibration
period of 50 Hz

(6) TCMD signal
The TCMD signal outputs a motor torque command.  It may be
different from the actual current (IR, IS) of the motor rotating at high
speed, because the motor produces a back electromotive force.

(1) Only the SVU1- 20(A06B- 6089- H102)has a built- in fan. If this fan
stops,an IPM alarm (“8.” in the LED indicator) is issued.  So, if this
alarm is issued on the SVU1- 20, first check that the fan is rotating.
A spare of the fan motor can be ordered using the spare list code
A06P- 6089- H102.

(2) After keeping the amplifier switched off for about ten minutes,
release the emergency stop condition.
� If the alarm was due to IPM overheat, it will not be issued this

time because the IPM is not hot any longer.  The probable causes
of IPM overheat include high ambient temperature and
excessively strict operating condition for the motor.Check for
these conditions.

� If the IPM alarm is still issued, go to (3).

(3) Disconnect the power wires from the amplifier terminals, and release
the emergency stop condition.
� If the IPM alarm is still issued, the probable cause is the operation

of the IPM protection function (overcurrent or power supply
failure).  Replace the IPM or amplifier.

� If the IPM alarm is not issued, go to (4).

(4) Disconnect the power wires from the amplifier terminals, and check
the U, V, and W wires for isolation from the grounding wire
sequentially.
� If they are isolated from the grounding wire, go to (5) and (6).

If any of the power wires is short- circuited to the grounding wire,
disconnect the power wires from the motor connector, and check the
U, V, and W terminals of the motor for isolation from the ground
terminal sequentially.

� If the U, V, or W terminal of the motor is short-circuited to the

� If they are isolated from the ground terminal, replace the power
wires.

(5) Connect the wires again,and observe the motor current (IR, IS)

(1) Make sure that the motor is not vibrating.

⇒ If a motor vibrates, the current flowing in it becomes more than
necessary, resulting in an alarm.

(2) Make sure that the power line to the motor is connected correctly.
⇒ If the connection is incorrect, an abnormal current flows in the 

motor, resulting in an alarm.

(3) Make sure that the following parameters are set correctly.

measure the waveform of the actual current (IR and IS) of the servo
amplifier module.  Start the motor and measure the actual current (IR
and IS).
⇒ If the actual current exceeds 1.4 times the rated current, the constant

for the acceleration/deceleration duration is too small,or the load on
the machine is too heavy for the capacity of the motor.

⇒ If the actual current exceeds 1.4 times the rated current during 
normal operation, the load on the machine is too heavy for the 
capacity of the motor.

If the adjustments described below cannot eliminate overflow, let us work
out the setting procedure individually.

Adjustment 1:  POA1 overflow (No. 8X47–1859–2047)

Use the tenfold POA1 setting function.
Note)  This function is available 
for 9060/L. 9070/C, 9046/A, 
and later versions.

� How to use the tenfold POA1 setting function
If POA1 is specified as a negative value, the absolute value is internally
multiplied by 10.  If the value you want to set is a positive value, specify
as follows:

(–1) � the desired setting/10

Adjustment 2:  One–pulse suppress (No. 1992–2099)
Reduce the setting according to the flowchart shown below.  If an
overflow occurs in the FS0C, stop using it, because the level parameter
is fixed at a standard value of 400.

Note 3 : Specification of the MCC (RELAY) confirmation contact
The C series amplifier makes the auxiliary contact (b-contact)
of the MCC, installed on the three-phase power line for motor
power, accessible to the outside. It is used to indicate when the
power to the motor is shut off.  On the other hand, the SVU and
SVUC make the auxiliary contact of the dynamic brake circuit
relay (in the SVU1-130 and SVUC1-130, a-contact, and for
others, b-contact) accessible to the outside, in order to indicate
when the motor power is shut off.

Other SVU and SVUC b contact T1 (7-8) RL2-RL3

a contact : In dynamic brake, its contact is open. 
b contact : In dynamic brake, its contact is short.

Note 4 : Conformance to TUV
Like the C series amplifier, the SVUC is not qualified for TUV
(because it has a built-in surge absorber for input protection).
When it is necessary to acquire qualification for CE marking,
use the SVU.
