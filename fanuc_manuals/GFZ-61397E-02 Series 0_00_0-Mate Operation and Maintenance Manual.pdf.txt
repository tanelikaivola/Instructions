2.5 CRT/MDI Operation and Display (with MMC)

(1) Operation

Key operation can only be done when the CNC screen is displayed on
the CRT display of the CRT/MDI panel. Address keys and numerical
keys are independently arranged on 00–C. However, inputting data is

exactly the same as that of 0–C. The page key  , cursor key

 , and selection key  on the software operator’s

panel are of combined use with the function key. Press the
corresponding key for use as a page key, cursor key, and selection key
on the software operator’s panel. Press the corresponding key while
pressing the “FUNC” key as the function key.
Five keys on the right half ten keys are effective for the variable section,
and the other five keys on the left half are effective for selecting position
display data in the fixed section.
When the number is specified by a method like the parameter screen,

because there is no NO. key use the cursor key  instead.

(2) Display

Press MMC/CNC  key on the CRT/MDI panel to display the CNC screen

when the MMC screen is displayed on the CRT display of the CRT/MDI
panel. 
The CNC screen consists of a variable section and a fixed section. The
variable section is the part that is surrounded by the frame at the bottom
right, and its display contents are the same as displayed on the 9” CRT
display of 0–C. Therefore, the screen selected by function key, page
key, cursor key, and soft key is displayed.
The fixed section is the rest of the above variable section, and its display
contents are position data, operation time (optional), modal data, and
S, T command value, as shown on the screen. Display items of this
section cannot be changed by the screen selection operation. However,
its display contents are always renewed.

CAUTION
1. A number of G codes can be specified in the same block.  When

more than one G code of the same group is specified, the G code
specified later is effective.

2. If any G code of group 01 is specified in a canned cycle mode, the
canned cycle is automatically cancelled and the G80 condition is
entered.  However a G code of group 01 is not affect4ed by any of
the canned cycle G codes.

NOTE

1. G codes marked   are initial G codes when turning power on.  
For G20 and G 21, the G code before turning power off remains.  G00
or G01 can be selected by parameter setting.

2. G codes of group 00 are not modal.  They are only effective in the block
in which they are specified.

3. If a G code not listed on the table of G codes is inputted, or optional G
code not specified in the system is commanded, an alarm (No. 010) is
displayed.

4. A G code is displayed from each group.

5. G code system B and C are options. Whether G code system B or C is
set by parameter No. 0036:  GSPC.

(Example)

Cycle 3:  connection 0, repetition 1
G05P10001L2;
Cycle is executed as 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3

High-speed remote 
buffer A (G05)

Specify G05 only in a block using normal NC 
command format.  Then specify move data in the 
special format explained next page.  When zero is spe-
cified as the travel distance along all axes, normal NC
command format can be used again for 
subsequent command specification.

High-speed remote 
buffer B (G05)

High-speed remote buffer A uses binary data.
On the other hand, high-speed remote buffer B can di-
rectly use NC language coded with equipment such as
an automatic programming unit to perform 
high-speed machining.

Advanced preview
 control (G08)

This function can minimize the delay caused by accel-
eration/deceleration, which increases together with the
feedrate, as well as the delay in the servo system.  Tool
movement can thus faithfully follow the command val-
ues, reducing the degree of error in the machined figure.

Functions Explanation

Change of offset value by
program (G10)

The tool compensation amount can be set or changed
with the G10 command.
When G10 is used in absolute input (G90), the 
compensation amount specified in the command
 becomes the new tool compensation amount.  
When G10 is used in incremental input (G91), the 
compensation amount specified in the command is
added to the amount currently set.

Change of offset value by
program (G10)

Change of parameter by

The parameter value can be changed by the 
machining program.

408 SPINDLE SERIAL
LINK START FAULT

This alarm is generated when the spindle con-
trol unit is not ready for starting correctly when
the power is turned on in the system with the se-
rial spindle.
The four reasons can be considered as follows:

1) An improperly connected optic cable, or
the spindle control unit’s power is OFF.

2) When the NC power was turned on under
alarm conditions other than SU–01 or
AL–24 which are shown on the LED dis-
play of the spindle control unit.
In this case, turn the spindle amplifier pow-
er off once and perform startup again.

3) Other reasons (improper combination of
hardware)
This alarm does not occur after the system
including the spindle control unit is acti-
vated.

409 SPINDLE ALARM
DETECTION

A spindle amplifier alarm occurred in a system
with a serial spindle.  The alarm is indicated as
”AL–XX” (where XX is a number) on the display
of the spindle amplifier.  For details, see Section
14.  Setting bit 7 of parameter No. 0397 causes
the spindle amplifier alarm number to appear on
the screen.
