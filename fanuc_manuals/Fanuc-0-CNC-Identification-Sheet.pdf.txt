Determination of Fanuc 0 Model Types 

 
To determine the version of the Fanuc 0 series CNC Control, check the master board number and/or the 
software version. The Master board number is found on the top left side of the main circuit board, usually 
mounted in the control cabinet that has the daughter card attached. It should not be confused with  
“A02B-????-????” numbers, which are Fanuc’s ordering numbers and are usually found on a sticker  
above the master board.   Use the following table to determine which unit you have. 
 
You can determine the software version by powering-up the control with E-stop active (button depressed). 
The control should hang on the software version screen (in the lower right corner of this screen, you will 
see the servo version number as well). 
 
As far as difficulty with installation, the process requires the following basic procedures: 
 

1. Back-up everything (using a computer and following Memex kit instructions); 
2. Write down NC system parameters, PMC parameters (in the Diagnostics area) and options; 
3. Power off and install the Memex memory components in the designated empty sockets; 
4. Power  up holding RESET & DELETE keys to re-initialize and erases all memory; 
5. Use special procedures to reload data in the proper sequence (as per kit instructi ons); 
6. Verify operation of the machine, and you are done!
