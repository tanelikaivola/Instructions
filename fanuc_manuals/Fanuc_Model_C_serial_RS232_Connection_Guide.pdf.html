<p>Fanuc 0 M/T Model C Serial (RS232) 
Connection Guide
</p>
<p> 
The Fanuc 0-C control has two RS-232 interfaces. Interface number 1 (M5) can be wired to the 
external DB25 female connector or wired to a built-in tape reader interface (at 4800 baud). 
Interface number 2 (M74) is an option and can be wired to the external DB25 female connector. 
The baud rate and other parameters are set in NC parameters (see below). For cable and signal 
descriptions see our  Fanuc RS232 Communications page or document at www.memex.ca.

</p>
<p>        
</p>
<p>   
</p>
<p>CNC 
Parameter 
</p>
<p>Port 1 
(M5) 
</p>
<p>Port 2

<p>Clearing Procedure 
</p>
<p>Delete All memory          -       Power On holding RESET + DELETE keys with PWE=1  
Delete Parameters         -       Power On holding RESET key with PWE = 1  
Delete Programs            -       Power On holding DELETE key with PWE = 1

<p>Standard Fanuc Serial Port: (DB-25 Female &amp; Honda) 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1 = Frame Ground              6 =  Data Set Ready  
2 = Transmit Data              7 =  Signal Ground  
3 = Receive Data               8 =  Carrier Detect  
4 = Ready To Send            20 = Error (Data Terminal Ready)  
5 = Clear To Send             25 = +24 Volts  
</p>
<p>The usual software handshaking cable configuration with a DB25 has 2, 3 crossed &amp; 7 connected 
straight through with Pins 4&amp;5 jumpered  (or brought through if hardware handshaking is enable 
which we recommend by the way), and lastly pins 6,8 &amp; 20 jumpered on the control side only.  
</p>
<p>The Fanuc Honda Connector (M5 or M74) is wired as such: 
</p>
<p>9 = Transmit Data              17 = GND  
8 = Receive Data               10 = FG or Shield  
20 = RTS                          14 = +24VDC  
19 = CTS  
5 = DTR   ---\  
18 = DSR ----|    &lt;-- Can be brought out or jumpered directly to prevent 86 CD Alarms  
16 = CD   ---/  
</p>
<p>The usual software handshaking cable configuration with a DB25 has 2, 3 crossed &amp; 7 connected 
straight through (with 4&amp;5 jumpered  - or used if hardware handshake lines are preferred) and 
pins 6,8 &amp; 20 jumpered on the control side only.  </p>

</p>
<p>Fanuc ISO Protocol: (E,7,x)  
</p>
<p>The standard protocol for Fanuc controls is 4800 or 9600 Baud, &ldquo;Even parity&rdquo;, &ldquo;7 data bits&rdquo; and 
either &ldquo;1 or 2 stop bits&rdquo; using DC1-4 Codes (XON/XOFF, PUNCH ON/OFF). See Parameters 
above.  
</p>
<p>Determination of Fanuc 0 Model Types  
</p>
<p>To determine the version of the Fanuc 0 series CNC Control, check the master board number 
and/or the software version. The Master board number is found on the top left side of the main 
circuit board, usually mounted in the control cabinet that has the daughter card attached. It should 
not be confused with &ldquo;A02B-????-????&rdquo; numbers, which are Fanuc&rsquo;s ordering numbers and are 
usually found on a sticker above the master board.    
</p>
<p>You can determine the software version by powering-up the control with E-stop active (button 
depressed). The control should hang on the software version screen (in the lower right corner of 
this screen, you will see the servo version number as well). Please note that Memex has a 
MxBRU (Battery Replacement Unit) available that provides a maintenance-free rechargeable 
Lithium battery backup for this control.  
</p>
<p>1985 / 1986  Fanuc 0-MA and Fanuc 0-TA 120M maximum battery backed resident memory.  
</p>
<p>1987 / 1989  Fanuc 0-MB and Fanuc 0-TB  320M maximum battery backed resident memory.  
</p>
<p>1990 / 1998  Fanuc 0- MC and Fanuc 0-TC 320M maximum battery backed resident memory.  
</p>
<p>Fanuc 0 DNC Drip-Feeding Note 
</p>
<p>Most machine tool builders enabled the ability for the CNC to run in drip feed mode (also called 
"Tape" mode, or "Auto" mode with a switch or keep relay set). You can determine if your machine 
supports running files of any length in this mode that executed each line directly if you can make 
the "DNCI" bit in the Diagnostics area go to a "1". The "DNCI" bit is G127.5 (or Diagnostic bit 127 
= xx1x xxxx). If you have a switch, keep relay (found in the Diagnostic section by the way) then 
you are good to go. Put the machine in DNC mode, make sure you are in AUTO mode, get your 
PC ready to send the file and hit Cycle Start to start executing code. The code never goes into 
the part program memory, so code of any length can be run. Make sure you have a good DNC 
setup as any data loss (due to bad cabling or faulty flow control) can cause a crash. Try our 
NetDNC software for a reliable communications link available as a free demo on our website.  
</p>
<p>(Note: If you have a Fanuc 0-M Model A (Digital)  with a A16B-1010-0210 masterboard 
and software version 412-08, we have a special DNC solution for you). </p>
