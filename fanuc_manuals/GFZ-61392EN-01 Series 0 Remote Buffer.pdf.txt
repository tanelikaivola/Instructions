It is used to perform communication between the remote buffer and host
computer.

When the both are ready to operate after power on, the communication
starts from the transmission of remote buffer and reception of host
computer and then the transmission/reception is repeated.

the CS signal is off, the first transmission is performed after turning
on the CS signal.

COMMUNICATION
SYSTEM



B–61392EN–1/01 4. PROTOCOL A

(2) The minimum time period between bytes is determined by the
parameter Ti (msec) of SET command. There is no prescription of
minimum time period between reception bytes.

(3) Switching from transmission to reception
Immediately the remote buffer side can be ready to receive signal.
Start transmission within the parameter setting time (To sec) at the
host computer side. When no response is obtained for the time period
(To or more), an error occurs in the host computer. (Overtime)

(4) Switching from reception to transmission
The remote buffer waits for Tx msec (parameter setting time) and
moves to the transmission process after completion of reception.
When there is no transmission after waiting another parameter (Tp
seconds), it is considered that an error occurred in the remote buffer.

(5) Overrun on reception
When the RS signal is turned off by the remote buffer on reception
of signal, stop the transmission within the overrun parameter number
bytes by the host computer. Request for retransmission is transmitted
when the above number is exceeded.

(6) Overrun on transmission
When the CS is turned off on transmission of remote buffer, the
transmission is suspended within 3 bytes including that which is
currently being transmitted.

5 EXPANSION PROTOCOL A
It allows the NC data between the remote buffer and host computer to be
efficiently transferred by adding the high–speed reception function to the
protocol A.



5. EXPANSION PROTOCOL A B–61392EN–1/01

24

The expansion protocol A is the same as the protocol A excluding the
transmission of NC data.

The expansion protocol A mode is initiated after the <GTD> is output to
the host computer by the remote buffer according to the data request from
the CNC side.

The communication system is performed in the full duplex mode in the
expansion protocol A. The NC data transmitted is packeted and is
transmitted to the remote buffer by the host computer. Also, perform the
reception process of monitor packet from the remote buffer.

The NC data is transferred to the remote buffer using the following format
by the host computer after receiving the <GTD>.

When the NC data transmitted becomes multiple packets, the packets can
be transmitted in order without waiting the response from the remote
buffer by the host computer.

NC data
(”256*n” byte)

Packet

(1 byte)

Checksum

End
code

(1 byte)

Calculation range of checksum

1) NC data

The NC data is the fixed length of “256*n” bytes and the n is specified
with the parameter (byte position 55 to 56) by the <SET> command.

The default value of n is 0. In the case of “ = 0”, the normal protocol
A is used.

n = 0: Normal protocol A

N = 1, 2, 4: Expansion protocol A

CAUTION
Note that n is set to 0 automatically even if n is set to the
values other than listed above.

2) Packet No.

a) Effective packet: 30h – 39h (ASCII code)

Always set the first packet No. to 30h. In other cases, the packet
No. 30h is transmitted to the host computer with the monitor
packet <NAK> of retransmission request by the remote buffer.

When data is sent by only one packet, set the packet No. to OFFh
(end packet).

Hereafter, the value incremented by 1 should be the packet No.

However, the value next to 39h becomes 30h.

Also, when the loss or improper order of packet No. is detected,
the improper packet No. is transmitted to the host computer slong
with the monitor packet <NAK>.

When the checksum error is detected, the improper packet No. is
transmitted to the host computer with the monitor packet <NAK>
of retransfer request by the remote buffer.

b) End packet: FFh

The end packet is transmitted by setting the packet No. to FFh.
The data part of end packet is considered to be the effective data.
However, the end packet received after transmitting <CAN>
ignores the data part.

This allows the expansion protocol A mode to be ended and the
normal protocol A mode is initiated.

However, when the checksum error is detected at the end packet, the
before packet No. +1 is transmitted as the end packet No. to the host
computer with monitor packet <NAK> of retransmission request.

The host computer should shift to the protocol A when the
command of protocol A is received after transmitting the end
packet.

c) Invalid packet: Other than above

Transmit this invalid packet with the dummy data of “256*n”
bytes when the time out may occur since time is required for
editing of NC data transmitted by the host computer.

The remote buffer is processed as an invalid packet.

3) Checksum

The checksum is obtained by adding the NC data to the packet No.
in units of byte and then expressing the 1 byte data produced by
neglecting the overflow above 8 bits out of the total value above using
ASCII 2–byte code.

4) End code

The end code should be the ASCII code CR (0Dh).



B–61392EN–1/01 5. EXPANSION PROTOCOL A

The monitor packets transmitted from the remote buffer to the host
computer are shown as below. All packets have the fixed length consisting
of 5 bytes.
1) Stop request

CAN 
(18h)

Meaningless 
(20h)

Checksum 
(2 byte)

End Code 
(0Dh)

The stop request is transmitted to the host computer by the remote
buffer when resetting the NC and stopping data reception by an alarm.
Transmit the end packet (the NC is dummy) after transmitting the
packet which is currently being transmitted and move to the normal
protocol A mode when this packet is received by the host computer.
When the packet being transferred is the end packet, an additional end
packet need not be transferred for acknowledgment of the CAN signal.
Transmit the end packet even in the DC3 reception status.

2) Retransmission request

NAK 
(15h)

Packet No. 
(1 byte)

Checksum 
(2 byte)

End Code 
(0Dh)

When a check sum error is detected in the received packet, the
retransmission request corresponding to the packet is transmitted by
the remote buffer.
The host computer should perform retransmission from the
corresponding packet immediately after ending the transmission of
packet which is currently being transmitted when it receives this packet.

3) Interruption request

DC3 
(93h)

Meaningless 
(20h)

Checksum 
(2 byte)

End Code 
(0Dh)

The interruption request is transmitted to the host computer by the
remote buffer when the reception buffer may become overflown.
The host computer should interrupt the transmission and wait until the
next monitor packet is received after completing the transmission of
packet which is currently being transmitted when it receives this packet.

4) Restart request

DC1 
(11h)

Meaningless 
(20h)

Checksum 
(2 byte)

End Code 
(0Dh)

The restart request is transmitted to the host computer by the remote
buffer when there is space in the reception buffer after requesting
interruption.
The host computer should restart the transmission from the next
packet following the interrupted one when this packet is received.

NOTE
If the end packet is currently being transmitted, end packet
transmission in response to CAN is not necessary.

One of two communication modes can be selected by setting parameter
SYNAK (bit 2 of No. 0051).



B–61392EN–1/01 6. PROTOCOL B

37

1) When parameter SYNAK is set to 0

The remote buffer turns on the ER signal and sends the DC1 code to
receive data from the host computer when the DNC operation starts
or NC programs start to be entered. When the buffer receives the EOR
code, it sends the DC3 code and turns off the ER signal to terminate
the data receiving process.

While the remote buffer receives data, if an alarm is issued in the NC
unit or if the NC unit is reset, the buffer sends the DC3 code and turns
off the ER signal to terminate the data receiving process.

6. PROTOCOL B B–61392EN–1/01

38

(5) The remote buffer transmits the DC1 code when the
remainder of buffer data becomes less than the level specified
and requests the host computer to start transmitting data.

(6) The host computer should start transmitting data again by the
DC1 code. The transmission data is a continuation of
previous data.

(7) The remote buffer transmits the DC3 code when the data read
is completed.
The end of data read is indicated by the detection of ER or NC
reset.

(8) The host computer stops transmission of data.

2) When parameter SYNAK is set to 1

When the remote buffer becomes ready after the power is turned on,
the buffer turns on the ER signal, which remains in the on state until
the power is turned off.

While the remote buffer does not receive data, and when the host
computer is ready for receiving signals, i.e. signals DR, CD and CS
are on, the buffer sends a signal as follows: If an alarm is issued in the
NC unit, the buffer sends the NAK code to the host computer. If the
NC unit is reset, the buffer sends the SYN code to the computer.

When the situation described above occurs while the remote buffer
is receiving data, the buffer sends the DC3 code to the host computer
before it sends the NAK or SYN code.

The interface of data part is in conformity the provisions of data which can
be handled through the serial port by the Series 0/00.

The end of data part is judged by the detection of EOR code. Also, all data
after EOR code is ignored.

In general, the data part configuration is as shown below. However, in the
case of DNC operaiton , the data already received will be lost by the CNC
reset.

(HIGH–SPEED REMOTE BUFFER B FUNCTION) B–61392EN–1/01

46

8 DISTRIBUTION PROCESSING FUNCTION (HIGH–SPEEDREMOTE BUFFER B FUNCTION)
In distribution processing, the remote buffer converts the NC program,
received from the host computer, to distribution data, then supplies the
converted distribution data to the CNC.  The use of this function enables
the high–speed DNC operation of an NC program which contains
consecutive commands specifying a minute amount of travel.

The remote buffer can perform distribution processing for up to three
axes.

Only the M series supports this function.  It cannot be used with the T
series.



B–61392EN–1/01
8. DISTRIBUTION PROCESSING FUNCTION

(HIGH–SPEED REMOTE BUFFER B FUNCTION)

47

This function uses the same format as that for ordinary NC programs.
Some sections of a program are, however, to be subjected to distribution
processing while other sections are passed directly to the CNC.

The sections to be subjected to distribution processing are called
high–speed machining sections.  High–speed machining sections are
defined using the following commands:

Command Description

G05P1; Start of high–speed machining section

G05P0; End of high–speed machining section

NOTE
Each of these commands must be specified using a single
separate block.

Any modal command specified in a distribution section is valid only
within that distribution section, with the exception of the feedrate.  After
the end of the high–speed machining section (G05P0;), therefore, specify
a command for restoring the modal information.

(1) Absolute/incremental

All move commands in a distribution section are assumed to be
incremental commands.

(2) Any command executed while distribution is stopped can vary the
modal state.

(3) Normal modal management is applied to the feedrate.

(1) Feedrate

When distribution by the remote buffer is used, the following
restrictions are imposed on the feedrate command:

1. Maximum cutting feedrate
Metric system : 1500 mm/min
Inch system : 600 inch/min

2. Any decimal places are ignored.

(2) Override

The cutting feedrate override is valid.  The override, however,
requires slightly longer to become effective because a buffer exists
between the remote buffer and CNC.  If such a delay would cause a
problem, the override should not be modified during operation.

(1) Single block stop cannot be specified in a high–speed machining
section.

(2) When the high–speed remote buffer function is used, the TV check
setting parameter must be set to disable TV check, regardless of
whether high–speed machining will be performed.

The CNC reads the data for 2 * N + 1 bytes (N: number of axes) from the
remote buffer. Thus, the transfer BAUD rate between the host and remote
buffer should be at least (2 * N + 1) * 11 / T * 1000 BAUD (T: unit time)
for the NC unit to continue machining without stopping halfway.

For example, the BAUD rate which is at least required when the unit time
is set to 16 ms is as shown below:

(2 * N + 1) bytes * 11 / 16 ms * 1000 (BAUD)

id only while this signal is set to ON.

RR 109 Input Receiver ready
This signal, if set to ON, indicates that the host computer
can transmit data to the remote buffer.  When this signal
is not used, always connect it to the TR signal on the re-
mote buffer.

TT 113 Output Transmission timing
The transmission clock for the remote buffer is output us-
ing this signal.  When a baud rate of 38400 or higher is
used, always connect this signal to the RT signal on the
host computer.

RT 115 Input Reception timing
The reception clock for the remote buffer is input using
this signal.  When a baud rate of 38400 or higher is used,
always connect this signal to the TT signal on the host
computer.

Connect the remote buffer to the battery unit on the memory printed
circuit board, using the supplied cable.

CAUTION
The terminal block on the battery unit uses screw terminals.
To connect the battery cable for the remote buffer to these
terminals, first disconnect the battery cable for the memory
printed circuit board or other components, with the CNC
power turned on.  Disconnecting the battery cable while the
CNC power is turned off will result in the loss of the data,
such as programs, stored on the memory printed circuit
board.
