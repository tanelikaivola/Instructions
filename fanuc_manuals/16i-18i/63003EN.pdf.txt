The i series control units are divided into two types:  the LCD–mounted
type and stand–alone type.

LCD–mounted type control units have a built–in display.  Stand–alone
type control units have a separate display unit.  In the following sections,
the LCD–mounted type is also referred to as the LCD–mounted type, and
the stand–alone type is also referred to as the stand–alone type.

The configuration and component names of each type are shown in the
figures given below.  This manual explains how to attach the connectors
shown in these figures to devices.  The numbers in parentheses () in the
figures are keyed to the item numbers of the descriptions in this manual.
The numbers in brackets [] in the figures are connector numbers.

Series 16i/18i/21i/20i LCD–mounted type control units  (A circle in the
table denotes that a unit is available.)

When a cabinet is designed, it must satisfy the environmental conditions
described in Section 3.1.  In addition, the magnetic interference on the
screen, noise resistance, and maintenance requirements must be
considered.  The cabinet design must meet the following conditions :

� The cabinet must be fully closed.

The cabinet must be designed to prevent the entry of airborne
dust,coolant,and organic solvent.

� The cabinet must be designed so that the permissible temperature of
each unit is not exceeded.  For actual heat design, see Section 3.4.

� A closed cabinet must be equipped with a fan to circulate the air
within.  (This is not necessary for a unit with fan.)
The fan must be adjusted so that the air moves at 0.5 m/sec along the
surface of each installed unit.

CAUTION
If the air blows directly from the fan to the unit, dust easily
adheres to the unit.  This may cause the unit to fail.  (This
is not necessary for a unit with fan.)

� For the air to move easily, a clearance of 100 mm is required between
each unit and the wall of the cabinet.  (This is not necessary for a unit
with fan.)

� Packing materials must be used for the cable port and the door in order
to seal the cabinet.

� The display unit must not be installed in such a place that coolant
would directly fall onto the unit.  The control unit has a dust–proof
front panel, but the unit should not be placed in a location where
coolant would directly fall onto it.

� Noise must be minimized.
As the machine and the CNC unit are reduced in size, the parts that
generate noise may be placed near noise–sensitive parts in the
magnetics cabinet.
The CNC unit is built to protect it from external noise.  Cabinet design
to minimize noise generation and to prevent it from being transmitted
to the CNC unit is necessary.  See section 3.6 for details of noise
elimination/management.

� When placing units in the cabinet, also consider ease of maintenance.
The units should be placed so that they can be checked and replaced
easily when maintenance is performed.

�  The hard disk drive and floppy disk drive must not be installed near
the source of a strong magnetic field.

� The installation conditions of the I/O unit and connector panel I/O
module must be satisfied.
To obtain good ventilation in the module, the I/O unit and connector
panel I/O module must be installed in the direction shown in the
following figure.  Clearances of 100 mm or more both above and
below the I/O unit are required for wiring and ventilation.
Equipment radiating too much heat must not be put below the I/O unit
and connector panel I/O module.

� Operating ambient temperature of control units with PC functions
A temperature sensor in each control unit monitors the temperature to
determine whether it is within the optimum range.

(1)When the temperature is out of range when the power is turned on
The control unit does not start until the temperature settles to within
the optimum range.

(2) If the temperature drifts out of range after normal start–up
Error occurs when the hard disk is accessed.

� A control unit with PC functions must be carefully isolated against
vibration.
The CNC control unit or hard disk unit itself may resonate at certain
frequencies.  Perform a thorough check after mounting the CNC
control unit on the machine.

CAUTION
For a control unit with PC functions data stored on the hard
disk may be destroyed due to operator errors or accidents
even when the environmental conditions above are
satisfied.  To guard against such data loss, back up the
important hard disk data regularly.  In particular, never turn
off the power, even momentarily, while the hard disk is being
accessed is running, as doing so is highly likely to destroy
part of the contents of the disk.  End users should be made
fully aware of this, to ensure that they do not inadvertently
lose important data.

� If a unit with PC functions is used, be careful when installing the MDI
unit.

(1)The MDI unit must be installed immediately below the control unit
allowing no space between the two units.

(2)The MDI unit must be installed vertically.



B–63003EN/03 3. INSTALLATION

The internal air temperature of the cabinet increases when the units and
parts installed in the cabinet generate heat.  Since the generated heat is
radiated from the surface of the cabinet, the temperature of the air in the
cabinet and the outside air balance at certain heat levels.   If the amount
of heat generated is constant, the larger the surface area of the cabinet, the
less the internal temperature rises.  The thermal design of the cabinet
refers to calculating the heat generated in the cabinet, evaluating the
surface area of the cabinet, and enlarging that surface area by installing
heat exchangers in the cabinet, if necessary.  Such a design method is
described in the following subsections.

The cooling capacity of a cabinet made of sheet metal is generally 6 W/°C
per 1m2 surface area, that is, when the 6W heat source is contained in a
cabinet having a surface area of 1 m2, the temperature of the air in the
cabinet rises by 1°C.  In this case the surface area of the cabinet  refers to
the area useful in cooling , that is, the area obtained by subtracting the area
of the cabinet touching the floor from the total surface area of the cabinet.
There are two preconditions : The air in the cabinet must be  circuited by
the fun, and the temperature of the air in the cabinet must be almost
constant.The following expression must then be satisfied to limit the
difference in temperature between the air in the cabinet and the outside air
to 13°C or less when the temperature in the cabinet rises:
   Internal heat loss P [W] x
   6[W/m2⋅°C] × surface area S[m2]×13[°C] of rise in temperature
For example, a cabinet having a surface area of 4m2 has a cooling capacity
of 24W/°C.  To limit the internal temperature increase to 13°C under these
conditions, the internal heat must not  exceed 312W.  If the actual internal
heat is 360W, however, the temperature in the cabinet rises by 15°C or
more.  When this happens, the cooling capacity of the cabinet must be
improved using the heat exchanger described next.
For the power magnetic cabinet containing a stand–alone type control
unit, the internal temperature rise must be suppressed to 10°C or less,
instead of 13°C.

If the temperature rise cannot be limited to the permissible temperature
or lower by the cooling capacity of the cabinet, a heat exchanger must be
added. The heat exchanger forcibly applies the air from both the inside
and outside of the cabinet to the cooling  fin to obtain effective cooling.
The heat exchanger enlarges the surface area. Section 3.5 explains five
heat exchangers supplied by FANUC.  Select one of these according to
the application.
If cooling fin A is used for the cabinet, the total cooling capacity of a
cabinet having a surface area of 4 m2 in the example above is improved
as follows :
   6W/m2⋅°C × 4m2 + 9.1W/°C= 33.1W/°C
The calculated value verifies that even if the internal heat is 360 W, the
temperature rise can be limited to less than 11°C.
See Section 3.5 for installing the heat exchanger.

With a small cabinet like the operator’s panel, the heat dissipating
capacity of the cabinet is as shown below, assuming that there is sufficient
mixing of the air inside the cabinet.
Coated metal surfaces:  8 W/m2°C
Plastic surfaces:  3.7 W/m2°C
An example of the thermal design for the cabinet shown in Fig. 3.4.4 is
shown below.

Air guide
chamber

120–mm square fan
motor (for air mixing)

Machine operator’s panel

Fig. 3.4.4

Assume the following.
Thermal exchange rates :  Coated metal surfaces  8 W/m2°C

:  Plastic surfaces  3.7 W/m2°C
:  Allowable temperature rise:  
  13°C higher than the exteriortemperature

Also, assume the following.
Dimensions of pendant type cabinet shown in Fig. 3.4.4(a):  

560(W) × 470(H) × 150(D) mm
Surface area of metallic sections : 0.5722 m2

Surface area of plastic sections : 0.2632 m2

In this case, the allowable total heat dissipation for the cabinet is:  
8 × 0.5722 × 13 + 3.7 × 0.2632 × 13 = 72 W.

In consequence, it can be concluded that the units shown in Table 3.4.4(a)
on the next page can be installed in this cabinet.

Fig. 3.5.1 (a)  Internal view of cooling fin

The cooling fin can be installed in two ways, as shown in Fig. 3.5.1 (a).
The following lists the general precautions to be observed when using the
cooling fins :

1) The fans are not included with the cooling fin.  They should be
provided by the machine tool builder.

2) Bring in the outside air from the bottom and exhaust the hot air from
the top.

Cooling Fin A/B/C



3. INSTALLATION B–63003EN/03

42

3) The inside air may flow from top to bottom or bottom to top.  However,
generally decide the direction as follows :

a) Bring in the air near high heat loss components.

b) Exhaust the air toward the most important components to be
cooled.

4) For the cooling fin to display the specified cooling capacity, the air inside
the cooling fins must flow at a velocity of 2.5 m/sec or greater.

(velocity of air flow measurement)

Set the slit to the intake side
and measure the velocity at
the slit.

Ã
Ã

Ã

5) Generally, install the cooling fins to the door.  But be sure that the door
does not bend when installing the cooling fin.  The cooling fins are
equipped with packing.

The heat pipe type heat exchanger is used for cooling the airtight cabinet
of small sized electronic devices.  It is a compact, lightweight, and
heat–efficient unit. Because the fan is built–in, it is used simply by
installing it,  performing the ‘panel cut’ operation.

Please install the heat exchanger by the following sequence:

1 Take out the external fan unit from the heat exchanger main unit. (Fig.
1)
Detach the external fan unit installation screws A (2 pieces), take out
the unit from the main unit by sliding it down, and detach the earth
cable and the power cable to the fan.  Also detach the installation screw
B (1 piece).

2 Install the heat exchanger main unit in the installation section which
has been panel cut. (Fig. 2)
When fastening down the heat exchanger main unit with the screws,
first, temporarily secure the panel and the heat exchanger main unit
with the installation screw B, which was taken out in 1).  After that,
secure the main unit by the installation screws.  In this case, the
external fan unit installation screw holes should be aligned with the
main unit screw holes.  (Please provide the installation screws for the
heat exchanger main unit.)
Because this product is composed of plastic, set the value shown
below for the screw tightening torque.

   Heat exchanger main unit  (M4 screw) : 11 kgf.cm

   External fan unit  (M3 screw) : 5 kgf.cm

3 Connect the power cable and the earth cable to the external fan unit (the
unit detached in 1), and secure the installation screw A to the main unit
from the outside.

The installation is now complete.

The CNC has been steadily reduced in size using surface–mount and
custom LSI technologies for electronic components. The CNC also is
designed to be protected from external noise.  However, it is difficult to
measure the level and frequency of noise quantitatively, and noise has
many uncertain factors. It is important to prevent both noise from being
generated and generated noise from being introduced into the CNC. This
precaution improves the stability of the CNC machine tool system.
The CNC component units are often installed close to the parts generating
noise in the power magnetics cabinet.  Possible noise sources into the
CNC are capacitive coupling, electromagnetic induction, and ground
loops.
When designing the power magnetics cabinet, guard against noise in the
machine as described in the following section.

The cables used for the CNC machine tool are classified as listed in the
following table:

The CNC machine tool uses the following three types of grounding:

� Signal grounding
Signal grounding supplies a reference potential (0 V) for electrical
signals.

� Grounding for protection
Grounding for protection is performed for safety reasons as well as to
shield against external and internal noise.  This type of grounding
includes, for example, the equipment frames, cases and panels of
units, and the shielding on interface cables connecting the equipment.

� Protective grounding (PE)
Protective grounding (PE) is performed to connect protection grounds
provided for equipment or between units to ground together at one
point as a grounding system.

� The ground resistance in protective grounding (PE) must be 100 Ω or
less (type D grounding).

� The cable used for protective grounding (PE) must be of a sufficient
cross section to allow current to flow safely into protective ground
(PE) if an accident such as a short–circuit occurs.  (Generally, a cross
section equal to or greater than that of the AC power cable is required.)

�  The cable connected to protective ground (PE) must be incorporated
into the AC power wire such that power cannot be supplied with the
ground wire disconnected.

The AC/DC solenoid and relay are used in the power magnetics cabinet.
A high pulse voltage is caused by coil inductance when these devices are
turned on or off.
This pulse voltage induced through the cable causes the electronic circuits
to be disturbed.

� Use a spark killer consisting of a resistor and capacitor in series.  This
type of spark killer is called a CR spark killer.(Use it under AC)
(A varistor is useful in clamping the peak voltage of the pulse voltage,
but cannot suppress the sudden rise of the pulse voltage.  FANUC
therefore recommends a CR spark killer.)

� The reference capacitance and resistance of the spark killer shall
conform to the following based on the current (I (A)) and DC
resistance of the stationary coil:

1) Resistance (R) : Equivalent DC resistance of the coil

2) Capacitance (C) :

If a cable connected to the CNC, servo amplifier, spindle amplifier, or
other device requires shielding, clamp the cable as shown below.  The
clamp both supports and shields the cable.  Use this clamp to ensure stable

Turn on the power to all the units at the same time, or in the following
sequence:

1 Power to the overall machine (200 VAC), power to the
separate detector (scale)

2 Power to slave I/O units connected via the I/O link, separate
detector interface unit, and stand–alone type LCD unit (24
VDC), servo amplifier control power supply (200 VAC)

3 Power to the CNC (24 VDC)

“Turning on the power to all the units at the same time” means completing
the power–on operations in 1 and 2 above within 500 ms of performing
power–on in 3.

When a separate detector (scale) is used, the output signal of the separate
detector must become stable within 500 ms of the separate detector
interface unit being turned on.

In some cases, the detector must be turned on prior to the separate detector
interface unit according to the specifications of the detector.

The power–on sequence for a stand–alone type LCD unit supporting the
display link and an intelligent terminal is undefined.

4.2.2

Turn off the power to all the units at the same time, or in the following
sequence:

1 Power to the CNC (24 VDC)
2 Power to the slave I/O units connected via the I/O link,

separate detector interface unit, and stand–alone type LCD
unit (24 VDC), servo amplifier control power supply (200
VAC), and power to any separate detector (scale)

3 Power to the overall machine (200 VAC)

“Turning off the power to all units at the same time” means completing
the power–off operations in 2 and 3 above within 500 ms before the
power–off operation described in 1 above.  If the power to the units
indicated in 2 or 3 is turned off other than within 500 ms of the power in
1 being turned off, alarm information is left in the NC.

The power–off sequence for a stand–alone type LCD unit supporting the
display link and an intelligent terminal is undefined.

CAUTION
When the i Series CNC with PC functions or an intelligent
terminal is used, the OS must be shut down before the
power to the control unit is turned off.  Be careful not to turn
off the power while the hard disk is being accessed or before
the OS has terminated; otherwise, the hardware contents
may be destroyed.

When the power is turned off or when the power is momentarily
disconnected, motor control is disabled.  Problems that may be generated
from the motor control disabled state should be handled from the
machine, as necessary.

For example, when movement along a vertical axis is controlled, a brake
should be applied to prevent falling.  Usually, the brake clamps the motor
when the servo is not activated or when the motor is not turning.  The
clamp is released only when the motor is turning.  When servo axis control
is disabled by power–off or momentary power disconnection, the brake
usually clamps the servo motor.  In this case, before the relay for clamping
operates, the controlled axis may fall.  So, also consider whether the
distance the axis is likely to fall will cause a problem.

BIOS data backup in the intelligent terminal Intelligent terminal

Preservation of the current position indicated
by the separate absolute pulse coder

Separate detector interface
unit

Preservation of the current position indicated
by the absolute pulse coder built into the motor

Servo amplifier

Used batteries must be discarded according to appropriate local
ordinances or rules.  When discarding batteries, insulate them by using
tape and so forth to prevent the battery terminals from short–circuiting.

Part programs, offset data, and system parameters are stored in CMOS
memory in the control unit.  The power to the CMOS memory is backed
up by a lithium battery mounted on the front panel of the control unit.  The
above data is not lost even when the main battery goes dead.  The backup
battery is mounted on the control unit at shipping.  This battery can
maintain the contents of memory for about a year.
When the voltage of the battery becomes low, alarm message “BAT”
blinks on the display and the battery alarm signal is output to the PMC.
When this alarm is displayed, replace the battery as soon as possible.  In
general, the battery can be replaced within two or three weeks, however,
this depends on the system configuration.
If the voltage of the battery becomes any lower, memory can no longer
be backed up.  Turning on the power to the control unit in this state causes
system alarm 910 (SRAM parity alarm) to occur because the contents of
memory are lost.  Clear the entire memory and reenter data after replacing
the battery.  
The following two kinds of batteries can be used.

� Lithium battery built into the CNC control unit.

� Two alkaline dry cells (size D) in the external battery case.

NOTE
A lithium battery is installed as standard at the factory.

A lithium battery is used to back up BIOS data in the intelligent terminal.
This battery is factory–set in the intelligent terminal.  This battery has
sufficient capacity to retain BIOS data for one year.

When the battery voltage becomes low, the LCD screen blinks.  (The LCD
screen also blinks if a fan alarm is issued.)  If the screen blinks, replace
the battery as soon as possible (within one week).  FANUC recommends
that the battery be replaced once per year regardless of whether a battery
alarm is issued.

(1)To guard against the possible loss or destruction of BIOS parameters,
write down the BIOS parameter values.

(2)Obtain a new lithium battery (A02B–0200–K102).

(3)After power has been supplied for at least five seconds, turn off the
power to intelligent terminal type 2.  Remove the intelligent terminal
from the panel so that replacement work can be done from the rear of
the intelligent terminal.

(4)Detach the connector of the lithium battery, and remove the battery
from the battery holder.

(5)Run the cable for the new lithium battery as shown in the figure.

(6)Attach the connector, and place the battery in the battery holder.

(7) Install intelligent terminal type 2 again.

(8)Turn on the power, and check that the BIOS parameters are maintained
(BIOS setup is not activated forcibly).

Between removing an old battery and inserting new battery, no more than
five minutes must be allowed to elapse.

One battery unit can maintain current position data for six absolute pulse
coders for a year.
When the voltage of the battery becomes low, APC alarms 3n6 to 3n8 (n:
axis number) are displayed on the CRT display.  When APC alarm 3n7
is displayed, replace the battery as soon as possible.  In general, the battery
should be replaced within two or three weeks, however, this depends on
the number of pulse coders used.
If the voltage of the battery becomes any lower, the current positions for
the pulse coders can no longer be maintained.  Turning on the power to
the control unit in this state causes APC alarm 3n0 (reference position
return request alarm) to occur.  Return the tool to the reference position
after replacing the battery.  
See Section 7.1.3 for details of connecting the battery to separate absolute
pulse coders.  The battery for the built–in absolute pulse coder is installed
in the servo amplifier.  For an explanation of the replacement procedure,
refer to the FANUC SERVO MOTOR a  Series Maintenance Manual.

This item describes the MDI interface when the machine tool
manufacturer makes his own MDI keyboard and connects it to the FS20i
controller.

CAUTION
1 To use the guidance program function, a standard MDI unit

is necessary.
For this reason, the machine tool builder cannot make his
own MDI keyboard.

2 This interface cannot be used on models other than the
FS20i.

NOTE
As the fitting on the CA55 side connector of the MDI cable
is a simple lock type, prevent a force of 1 kg or more from
being applied to the connector section. Also clamp it down
to prevent a large force from being applied by vibration.
Note, however, that shielding or clamping are not necessary
if the cable length is within 50 cm.

(a) The total length of the cables (J127, J128, and J143) between the
detachable LCD/MDI unit and control unit must not exceed 50 m.

(b)The cables J127, J128, and J132 also serve as the 24 VDC power
line for the detachable LCD/MDI unit.  On the 24 VDC line, a
voltage drop which corresponds to the resistances of the 24 V and
0 V lines of these cables occurs.  Considering this voltage drop,
determine the cable length so that 24 VDC ±10% is provided at the
CA50 connector of the unit.

(c) While the power is turned on, only the connector (shaded in the
figure above) of the connection panel can be attached or detached.
The other connectors (such as CA50 and JD41) must not be
attached and detached while the power is turned on.

An input/output device is used to enter information such as CNC
programs and parameters from an external device to the CNC, or to output
information from the CNC to an external device.
The input/output devices usable with the i Series CNC include Handy
File.  The interface of the input/output devices electrically conforms to
RS–232–C, so that a connection can be made with a device that has an
RS–232–C interface.
The tables below indicate the serial ports of the i Series CNC.  For the
serial ports on the remote buffer, see Chapter 12.  For the serial ports on
the personal computer and intelligent terminal, see Chapters 8 and 9.

NOTE
This interface is based on the RS–232–C interface of the CNC.  Therefore, for a Series 210i CNC
control unit with PC functions, the parameters and programs should be input and output using
the RS–232–C interface of the personal computer (JD33).  However, the interface shown above
can be used when using any of the following functions which are processed directly by the CNC.
Cases in which this RS–232–C interface is used when a Series 210i with PC functions is used

Ladder uploading or downloading via RS–232–C using FAPT–LADDER or FAPT–LADDER II

Ladder monitoring from an external PC using FAPT–LADDER II

NOTE
The listed control codes are used for both EIA and ISO.

In this interface, control codes DC1 to DC4 are used.

(a) NC can control external device by issuing codes DC1 to DC4.

(b)When external processing falls behind the pace of the NC signals
(When NC issues data)

(i) External device can temporarily stop NC data output by using the
NC’s CS signal. Data output stops within two characters including
a currently transmitting character when CS OFF signal is input to
NC. When CS signal is turned on again, data transmission start.

(ii)If control code DC3 is input to NC, NC stops data output within ten
characters. When control code DC1 is input to NC, NC starts
sending data again.

(c) When the external device is equipped with an ISO/EIA converter, the
external device must satisfy the specification shown in Table 5.3.4 (a).

2 Control codes DC1 to DC4 are transmission codes output
from the NC. So they need not to be punched on the NC
tape.

(iii) Transmission rate (Baud rate)
The transmission rate (Baud rate) is the number of bits transferred per
second.
The following baud rates are available depending on the system
parameter.

50, 100, 110, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600.
(Example)

Baud rate : 110

When using one start bit and two stop bits (totalling 11 bits
per character):

Transmission characters/second= 110

11
=10 characters/second 

(Max.)

(iv) Cable length
The cable length depends on the external device type. Consult with the
device manufacturers for actual connecting cable lengths.
When cable A (A66L–0001–0041) is used, cable length is as follows
by the specification of NC.

for RS–232C 100m or less ... 4800 bauds or less

50m or less ... 9600 bauds or less

(1)NC outputs DC1.

(2)The external device starts sending data upon receiving DC1.

(3)NC sends DC3 when NC processing is delayed.

(4)The external device stops sending data to NC after receiving DC3.
The device may send up to 10 characters after receiving DC3. If it
sends more than 10 characters, alarm 087 will occur.

(5)NC reissues DC1 upon completing delayed processing.

(6)The external device restarts data output upon receiving the DC1 code
(the data must be the next data to the preceding.)

(7)NC sends DC3 upon completing data read.

(8)The external device stops sending data.

(1)NC output DC2.

(2)NC outputs punch data in succession.

(3)When data processing is delayed at the external device.

(a) Data output stops within two characters including a currently
transmitting character when CS signal is turned off.
When CS signal is turned on again, data transmission starts. (See Fig.
5.3.4 (b))

(b) If control code DC3 is input to NC, NC stops data output within ten
characters. When control code DC1 is input to NC, NC starts sending
data again. (See Fig. 5.3.4 (c))

(4)The NC starts sending the next data if the CS signal is turned on after
the external device completes data processing.

(5)The NC issues DC4 upon completing data output.

� When the cable is 20 m or longer
� When the power magnetics cabinet containing a spindle

amplifier cannot be connected with the operator’s panel
cabinet containing a CNC control unit via a ground wire
with a cross–sectional area of 5.5 mm2 or more

� When the cable is subject to significant noise.  For
example, when there is a strong electromagnetic noise
source such as a welding machine near the cable, or
when the cable runs in parallel with a power line or power
magnetics cable that can generate noise.

2 The recommended cable connector FI30–20S
(manufactured by Hirose Electric) cannot be used for the
stand–alone type i Series CNC and JA7B.

Conditions for installing the serial spindle connector panel

� The serial spindle connector panel does not have an enclosed structure.
So, install the serial spindle connector panel in an enclosed cabinet as
used for the CNC.

� Ground the case by using the case mounting screws of the serial
spindle connector panel.

� The serial spindle connector panel is light, so that it need not be
secured with screws.  However, ensure that the serial spindle
connector panel does not contact other electrical circuits and thus
cause a short circuit.  When securing the serial spindle connector panel
to the cabinet, for example, attach an L–shaped metal fitting as shown
below with a case mounting screw (M3) of the serial spindle connector
panel.

The connection between the CNC control unit and the servo amplifiers
should use only one optical fiber cable, regardless of the number of
controlled axes.  See APPENDIX D for details on the optical fiber cable.

In the control unit, the COP10A connector is placed on the servo card
installed on the main board.  When a sub–CPU card is used, COP10A is
placed on the servo card installed on the sub–CPU board as well.

When a separate pulse coder or linear scale is used, a separate detector
interface unit, as shown above, is required.  The separate detector
interface unit should be connected to the CNC control unit through an
optical fiber cable, as one of the units on the servo interface (FSSB).
Although the above figure shows the separate detector interface
connected in the final stage of the FSSB line, it can also be connected, at
the nearest location, to the CNC control unit.  Or, it can be installed
between two servo amplifier modules.



B–63003EN/03 7. SERVO INTERFACE

Usually, the separate detector corresponding to a servo motor for each of
the first to eighth axes is connected to each of separate detector interfaces
JF101 to JF108.  If necessary, the controlled axis numbers corresponding
to JF101 to JF108 can be changed.  For example, when separate detectors
are to be used only for the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth controlled axes
in the above figure, JF101 to JF104 of the basic interface unit can be
assigned to these controlled axes, thus eliminating the need to use an
expansion unit.  The interface unit can feed 0.35 A (5 V) to each separate
detector.

The standard of the feedback signal from the additional detector is as
shown below.

(1)A and B phase signal input

This is a method to input position information by the mutual 90 degree
phase slip of A and B phase signals.
Detection of the position is performed with the state in which the B phase
is leading taken as a shift in the plus direction, and the state in which the
A phase is leading as a shift in the minus direction.

TD y  0.15 µsec

The signals for these connectors are differential input signals with A and
B phases.  An important factor is time TD from point A, when the
potential difference between PCA and *PCA exceeds 0.5V, to point B,
when the potential difference between PCB and *PCB becomes lower
than 0.5V.  The minimum value of TD is 0.15 µs.  The period and pulse

(1)Use an interface unit in a completely enclosed cabinet.

(2) Install an interface unit on a vertical surface, and provide a space
of 100 mm above and below the unit.  Below an interface unit, do
not place equipment that generates a large amount of heat.

(3)When using a basic unit and expansion unit, place the units as
shown below so that the flat cable connecting the units does not
block the vent holes.  A flat cable not longer than 100 mm must be
used.

(1)Use the unit in a fully sealed cabinet.

(2) Install the unit on a vertical plane, and allow a clearance of 100 mm
or more above and below the unit.  Never place a device that generates
a large amount of heat below the unit.

(3)For the outside dimensions of the unit, see Appendix A.

NOTE
To install/remove the unit, a screwdriver must be inserted
obliquely.  So, sufficient access clearances are required on
both sides of the unit.  As a guideline, if the front of an
adjacent unit appears flush with the unit or slightly set back,
allow a clearance of about 20 mm between the unit and the
adjacent unit.  If the front of an adjacent unit protrudes
beyond the front of the unit, allow a clearance of about 70
mm between the unit and the adjacent unit.  Also, when
installing the unit near a side of the cabinet, allow a
clearance of about 70 mm between the unit and the side of
the cabinet.

NOTE
1 This is an IBM PC–compatible standard interface.  Particular care should be paid to the

following points, however.
(1)Only two modes (720K/1.44M bytes) can be used.
(2)“DENSEL” is fixed to the low level.
(3)Not all commercially available floppy disk drives require both +12 V and +5 V DC.  When

using a floppy disk drive which requires +12 V DC, pay careful attention to its power
requirements.

2 Since many commercially available floppy disk drives perform differently with any one given
personal computer, FANUC cannot guarantee all operations.  Machine tool builders are
requested to confirm the compatibility of each drive, and the operations that are supported.
Also, be careful when using commercially available floppy disk drives because none offer
dust–proof or drip–proof properties.

3 The FDD–side interface shown above is merely an example.  Each cable should be designed
according to the interface of the actual drive to be used.

This is the IBM PC standard interface.  Commercially available
connecting cables feature wires for pins 10 to 16 that are twisted
between the CNC and drive A, as shown in the above figure.  When
using such a cable, set the “Drive number setting pin” on drive A to
“1” (second drive).  Connect the floppy disk unit (A02B–0207–C006)
provided by FANUC to connector A, shown above.

When this unit is to remain attached to the machine at all times, pay
particular attention to the points below.

(1)Dust
The sides of the unit are all perforated, with the exception of the front
door.  So, place the unit in a fully sealed cabinet.  Dust can enter the
floppy disk unit and cabinet through the floppy disk slot.  This means
that floppy disk failures are more likely to occur in a dusty
environment.

(2)Temperature
+5°C to +45°C (operating)
The ambient temperature requirements for this unit are severer
because of the restrictions imposed by the floppy disk unit.  So, pay
special attention to the method of cooling.  Providing an air flow
directly from a cooling fan is not recommended because dust can build
up.

Never turn off the power while a floppy disk is inserted and particularly
while the inserted floppy disk is being accessed (while the LED is lit).
This caution should be conveyed to the end users.

When using intelligent terminal type 2, observe the following conditions
relating to the cabinet in which the terminal is installed.

Ambient temperature Operating:  5°C to 45°C (*1)
Storage:  –20°C to 60°C

Temperature drift 20°C/hour (maximum)

Ambient relative
humidity

Regular:  10% to 75% (without condensation)
Short term (within one month):  10% to 90% (without
condensation)

Vibration Operating:  0.5 G or less(*2)
Storage:  1.0 G or less

Atmosphere Enclosure in a completely sealed cabinet

Altitude Operating:  –60 to 1000 m
Storage:  –60 to 1200 m

*1 Operating ambient temperature:
A temperature sensor in the intelligent terminal type 2 is used to check
whether the temperature range described above is satisfied.  (The
detected state can be confirmed from the LEDs on the high–speed
serial bus interface board of the CNC.)
1) If the specified temperature range is not satisfied when the power

is switched on, the system hangs without displaying anything on
the screen.  This error status can be confirmed using the LEDs
mentioned above.  When the temperature falls within the specified
range the system,  including the terminal, starts automatically.

2) If the temperature moves outside the specified range after the
system starts, an error is detected when an attempt is made to access
the hard disk.

*2 Vibration:
The intelligent terminal type 2 and its built–in hard disk may be
subject to vibration.  After the terminal is mounted on the machine,
carefully check for vibration.  If an ISA expansion board is used, the
vibration tolerance may be lower than that listed above, depending on
the specification of the card.

CAUTION
Even when the environmental conditions listed above are
satisfied, an operator error or an accident may destroy data
on the hard disk.  This is quite likely if the power is switched
off while the hard disk is being accessed.  Do NOT switch
off the power while the hard disk is being accessed.  Be sure
inform end users of this caution.  Always create and keep
a backup copy of the data on the hard disk to prepare for the
worst case.

Also note that options for development and maintenance use may not
satisfy the above requirements.

(1) Input power

(a) Specification
To use the intelligent terminal type 2, prepare a power supply that
satisfies the requirements listed below:

Input power supply voltage +24 VDC ±10%

Input power supply current 3.5 A (maximum)

NOTE
Use of the FANUC I/O unit also requires +1 A.

(b)Timing
The intelligent terminal type 2 should be switched on and off
within ±100 ms of the CNC power supply being switched on and
off.

(2)Supply power
The intelligent terminal type 2 can supply power, as listed below, to
peripheral equipment.  Check the amount of current drawn by each
unit you want to use.

Supply voltage Peripheral unit Current (maxi-
mum)

+12V ISA,
FDD (CN2)

400mA

+5V FDD (CN2), keyboard

1000mA

ISA 3500mA

–12V ISA 180mA

–5V ISA 74mA

(3)Heat dissipation
37 W (during normal operation)

NOTE
The amount of heat generated by the intelligent terminal
type 2 increases if a peripheral unit or ISA expansion board
is connected.

Before switching off the intelligent terminal type 2, terminate all
applications and the OS according to the normal shutdown procedure.  If
the terminal is switched off while an application or the OS is still running,
the terminal may fail to operate normally next time it is switched on.  In
the worst case, the initialization command for the hard disk drive may
become inoperable.

The space shown below must be available around the intelligent terminal
type 2 after it is installed.

A: Space for cables.  Provide an appropriate area at A so that the cables
to be used can be installed.  If an ISA expansion board is used,
determine dimension X so that the cable to be used with the ISA
expansion board can be installed.

B: This space is required for battery replacement in the intelligent
terminal mounted on the panel.  Battery replacement requires that the
operator work at the rear of the terminal.

NOTE

1 This is a standard interface for the IBM PC compatible.  Note the following:
� Only two floppy disk density modes (720 Kbytes and 1.44 Mbytes) are supported.
� The DENSEL signal level is fixed to low.
� Not all commercial floppy disk drives require both +12 V and +5 V power supplies.  If your

floppy disk drive requires +12 VDC, pay careful attention to its power requirements.
2 Commercial floppy disk drives are prone to compatibility problems with personal computers to

some degree.  It is not guaranteed that the intelligent terminal type 2 can operate with every
commercial floppy disk drive.  Machine tool builders are requested to check the operability of
the floppy disk drives they select.  Keep in mind that commercial floppy disk drives are neither
dust–proof nor moisture–resistant.

3 The interface on the drive side shown above is only an example.  Design an interface cable
according to the specification of the drive with which it is used.

This is the standard interface for the IBM PC compatible.
Commercially available cables are cross–connected between pins 10
and 16 (between the CNC and drive A) as shown above.  In this case,
“drive No. setting pin” on drive A should be set to 1 (second drive).
The floppy disk unit (A02B–0207–C006) offered by FANUC should
be attached to connector A, described above.

When using this unit on the machine, observe the following cautions:

(1)Dust
Because the intelligent terminal type 2 is not covered with panels,
except for the front door section, it must be enclosed in a sealed
cabinet.  While the door is open, dust can enter the floppy disk unit and
cabinet via the disk insertion slot.  If the terminal is installed in a dusty
environment, more floppy disk failures than normal may occur.

(2)Temperature
+5°C to +45°C (operating)
The operating temperature range for this unit is stricter than ordinary
units because of the restrictions imposed by the floppy disk.  So, pay
special attention to the way it is cooled.  
Avoid blowing air directly from a cooling fan, as dust in the air may
stick to the components of the unit.

Do NOT switch on the power to intelligent terminal type 2 while a floppy
disk is inserted, and especially when the floppy disk is being accessed
(LED is on).  Machine tool builders are requested to provide this
information to their end users.

(1)Address map

� Intelligent terminal type 2 uses the same memory space
configuration as the IBM PC and compatibles.  It cannot use
E0000H to EFFFFH, however.

� The ISA expansion board cannot use the I/O space between 0280H
and 028FH, because the intelligent terminal type 2 uses this I/O
space.  However, these addresses can be changed using the rotary
switch on the main printed–circuit board.

The I/O addresses for the intelligent terminal
type 2 are LMN0H to LMNFH.  They are
factory–set as follows:
L = 0 (SW3)
M = 2 (SW2)
N = 8 (SW1)

9.8.2
Handling Precautions



9. FANUC INTELLIGENT TERMINAL TYPE 2 B–63003EN/03

216

The other areas for intelligent terminal type 2 are the same as for the
IBM PC and compatibles.

� COM1, COM2, and parallel ports are specified at setup.

(2) Interrupt and DMA requests

� The IRQ signals not used by the intelligent terminal type 2 are as
follows:  IRQ10 and IRQ11

� The DRQ signal used by the intelligent terminal type 2 is as
follows:  DRQ2 (floppy disk drive)

(3)Allowable power supply current
For the allowable power supply current for the ISA expansion board,
see Section 9.5.2, “Power supply specification.”

(4)Cabling
For cabling, see Section 9.6, “Installation Space.”

(5)Environmental conditions for ISA expansion board installation
For the environmental conditions that must be satisfied when
installing an ISA expansion board, see the respective ISA expansion
board specifications.  If your ISA expansion board does not satisfy the
conditions stated in Section 9.5.1, “Installation environmental
conditions,” the environmental conditions for your intelligent
terminal type 2 will default to those for your ISA expansion board.

(6)Miscellaneous
In addition to the handling precautions stated above, the ISA
expansion board may not operate normally if:

� Its ISA signal is pulled up or down.

� It uses the ISA bus refresh cycle.

� It functions as the bus master to perform 8–bit write access to the
host.
Note that the AHA–154 SCSI interface board manufactured by
Adaptec cannot be used in intelligent terminal type 2.

It is likely that conditions will be added in the future.

FANUC does not guarantee the normal operation of any ISA
expansion board.  In addition, FANUC is not able to provide
troubleshooting or maintenance related to ISA expansion
boards.

10 CONNECTION TO FANUC I/O Link



10. CONNECTION TO FANUC I/O Link B–63003EN/03

218

The FANUC I/O Link is a serial interface which connects the CNC, cell
controller, I/O Unit–A, or Power Mate and transfers I/O signals (bit data)
at high speeds between each device.  The FANUC I/O Link regards one
device as the master and other devices as slaves when more than one
device is connected.  Input signals from the slaves are sent to the master
at specified intervals.  Output signals from the master are also sent to the
slaves at specified intervals.

10.1
GENERAL



B–63003EN/03 10. CONNECTION TO FANUC I/O Link

219

On i Series, the interface connector JD1A for I/O Link is provided on the
main board.
In the I/O there are the master station and its slave stations.  The master
is the control unit of the CNC, and the slave is the I/O unit–A.  The slaves
are divided into groups, and up to 16 groups can be connected to one I/O
Link.  A maximum of two base I/O units can be connected as a group.
The I/O Link is connected in different ways depending on the types of
units actually used and the I/O points.  To connect the I/O Link, the
assignment and addresses of the I/O signals have been made
programmable with the PMC program.  The maximum number of I/O
points is 1024.
The two connectors of the I/O Link are named JD1A and JD1B, and are
common to all units (that have I/O Link function).  A cable is always
connected from JD1A of a unit to JD1B of the next unit.  Although JD1A
of the last unit is not used and left open, it need not be connected with a
terminator.
The pin assignments of connectors JD1A and JD1B are common to all
units on the I/O Link, and are illustrated on Subsec. 10.2.1.  Use the
figures when connecting the I/O Link irrespective of the type of unit.

NOTE
1 Ensure that the extension module with the MPG interface is located nearest to the basic

module, as shown in the figure. The MPG can be connected to the connector panel I/O module
only when the i series CNC is used.  When the connector panel I/O module is used together
with a unit (such as an operator’s panel I/O module) connected to the I/O Link supporting
another MPG interface, only the MPG interface of the unit (module) closest to the CNC
connected to the I/O Link is effective.

2 The connection diagram above shows an example of using a DI/DO module, 2A output module,
and analog input module as expansion modules.  These expansion modules can be used in
any combination.

NOTE
1 The DI and DO addresses for the basic and extension

modules run contiguously.  These basic and extension
module DI and DO addresses are allocated to the I/O Link
as a group.  For example, when the DI and DO top
addresses are X0004 and Y0000 (m = 4 and n = 0),
respectively, then the addresses are allocated as shown in
the following table.

2 Pins 18 and 50 (+24V) of connector CB150 are used to
apply 24 V externally to a module.  Be sure to connect these
pins because the +24 V applied to the module is used
internally.

Pin number

NOTE
Xm+0.0 through Xm+0.7 are DI pins for which a common voltage can be selected.  That is, by
connecting the DICOM0 CB150(24) pin to the +24 V power supply, a DI signal can be input with
its logical state reversed.  If, however, a cable is connected to ground, it has the same effect
as inputting an ON state DI signal.  To prevent such accidents, the connection of the DICOM0
CB150(24) pin to the 0 V power supply is recommended whereever possible.

For safety reasons, the emergency stop signal needs to be allocated to an appropriate bit of
the addresses for which the common voltage is fixed, ranging from Xm+1.0 to Xm+1.7 or from
Xm+2.0 to Xm+2.7.  See 9.4.20 for information about how to allocate the emergency stop
signal.

For unused DI pins allocated to the addresses for which the common voltage is fixed (from
Xm+1.0 to Xm+1.7 and from Xm+2.0 to Xm+2.7), the logic is fixed to “0”.  For unused pins
allocated to Xm+0.0 to Xm+0.7 for which the common voltage can be selected, the logic is fixed
to “0” when the DICOM0 CB150(24) pin is connected to the 0 V power supply.  When the
DICOM0 CB150(24) pin is connected to the +24 V power supply, the logic is fixed to “1”. The
logic of the unused pins allocated to Xm+0.0 to Xm+0.7 is variable when the contact of the
DICOM0 CB150(24) pin is open.

This section describes the specifications of the DI/DO signals used with
the basic module and expansion modules A and B.

DI (input signal specifications)

Number of points 24 points (per module)

Contact rating 30 VDC, 16 mA or more

Leakage current between
contacts when opened

1 mA or less (26.4 V)

Voltage decrease between
contacts when closed

2 V or less (including a cable voltage decrease)

Delay time The receiver delay time is 2 ms (maximum).  In
addition, [I/O Link transfer time between CNC and
I/O module (2 ms maximum)] + [ladder scan period
(depending on CNC)] must be considered.

DO (output signal specifications)

Number of points 16 points (per module)

Maximum load current
when ON

200 mA or less including momentary variations

Saturation voltage when
ON

1 V (maximum) when the load current is 200 mA

Withstand voltage 24 V +20% or less including momentary variations

Leakage current when
OFF

20 µA or less

Delay time The driver delay time is 50 µs (maximum).  In
addition, [I/O Link transfer time between CNC and
I/O module (2 ms maximum)] + [ladder scan period
(depending on CNC)] needs to be considered.

ON/OFF of the power supply (DO common) for DO signals (output
signals) 
By turning off (opening) the power supply pin (DOCOM) for the DO
signals (output signals), all the DO signals of each module can be turned
off at the same time.  At this time, the DO state is as shown below.

NOTE
When DO is on in the sequence, the ON/OFF state of
DOCOM is directly reflected in the DO state as indicated
above by the dashed box.  The +24 V signal to be supplied
to the I/O module must not be turned off during operation.
Otherwise, a CNC communication alarm is issued.  Ensure
that +24 V is supplied either when or before the power to the
CNC is turned on, and that +24 V is removed either when
or after the power to the CNC is turned off.

Parallel DO (output signal) connection 
A DO load current of twice the level can be obtained by connecting DO
points in parallel and exercising ON/OFF control at the same time in the
sequence.  Namely, the maximum load current per DO point is 200 mA.
By connecting two DO points in parallel and turning on the two DO points
at the same time, 400 mA can be obtained.  In this case, however, the
leakage current is doubled up to 40 µA when the DO points are turned off.

This analog input module has four input channels.  The
digital output section consists of a group of 12 bits within the
three–byte occupied input points.  This means that the
channel to be used can be dynamically selected by the
ladder.  The channel switching DO point for channel
selection is included in the two–byte occupied output points.

D00 to D11 represent 12–bit digital output data.  D00 and D11 correspond
to weightings of 20 and 211, respectively.
D11 is a sign bit expressed as a two’s complement.  CHA and CHB
represent analog input channels.  
This means that when the two bytes above are read with a PMC program,
the A–D converted data of the CHA and CHB input channels can be read
from D11 to D00.  For CHA and CHB, see the description of channel
selection, below.
Section 6.3 provides notes on reading data with a PMC program.

(Channel selection)

With this analog input module, which of the four channels is to be output
to the digital output section must be determined with a PMC program.
The DO points used for this selection are CHA and CHB (two–byte
occupied output points).  These are mapped as indicated below.

(These cables do not include the wire shown in the above figure.)

NOTE
The number of connectable manual pulse generators
depends on the type and option configuration.

Like a pulse coder, the manual pulse generator operates on 5 VDC.  The
supply voltage drop due to the cable resistance must be held below 0.2 V
(when those of the 0–volt and 5–volt wires are combined), as expressed
in the following expression:

Where
0.1 = manual pulse generator supply current (0.1 A)
R = resistance per unit cable length (W/m)
m = number of 0–volt and 5–volt wires
L = cable length (m).

Therefore, the cable length can be determined using the following
expression.

In the case of the A66L–0001–0286 cable, for example, when three pairs
of signal wires and six power supply wires (20/0.18, 0.0394 W/m) are
used (three power supply wires connected to 5 V and the other three to 0
V), the cable length is:

However, the maximum pulse transmission distance for the manual pulse
generator is 50 m.  Taking this into consideration, the cable length may
be extended to:
38.37 m (when two generators are used), or
25.58 m (when three generators are used).

In the case of the FS20i, four manual pulse generators are sometimes
connected. However, only up to three manual pulse generators can be
connected to the separate wiring I/O module or to the control panel I/O
module. For this reason, in the case of the FS20i, two separate wiring I/O
modules or control panel I/O modules having a manual pulse generator
interface are used. Even in a combination of two of these modules having
the same specifications, the connection is possible even in a combination
of one of each of these modules.
Connect these two modules by I/O–Link, and connect the three manual
pulse generators to the module close to the controller, and the remaining
manual pulse generator to the module next closest to the controller.

NOTE
This method of use is applied only in the case of the FS20i,
and cannot be used on other machine types.

Example)
The following describes an example of input signal assignments when
a control panel I/O module (A20B–2002–0470) and a separate wiring
module (A20B–2002–0520) are used.

� Assign 16 bytes from x0008 as the start of the input signal on
A20B–2002–0470 and 16 bytes from x0024 as the start of the input

NOTE
Modules need to be spaced at least 32 mm apart, in which case a flat cable of about 20 mm
in length is required.  To install modules further away from each other, the cable length will be
20 mm plus the extra distance.  Note that the maximum length of a flat cable is 100 mm.  To
ensure adequate ventilation, install the modules in such a way that the flat cables lie on top of
them.  The basic module has a vent at the top (as indicated by the dotted lines in the above
figure).  When connecting modules, install extension modules so that the flat cables do not
cover the vent, as shown in the above figure.
Therefore, for direct connection to the connection printed circuit board, expansion modules are
installed to the right of the basic module on the installation plane.  For installation using DIN
rails or screws, expansion modules are installed to the left of the basic module on the installation
plane.

If a system alarm occurs in a CNC using the connector panel I/O module,
or if I/O Link communication between the CNC and connector panel I/O
module fails, all the DO signals of the I/O module are turned off.
Therefore, due care must be taken when setting up the machine sequence.
Also, the same phenomenon occurs if the power to the CNC or the I/O
module is turned off.

For the connector panel I/O module, I/O addresses are mapped as follows.

The basic connector panel I/O module is allocated a group of DI addresses
(16 bytes) and a group of DO addresses (8 bytes).  Up to three hardware
extension modules can be added or removed as required.  The reason for
this address allocation is explained below.
The MPG interface (MPG counter) occupies a DI space from Xm+12
through Xm+14.  These addresses are fixed regardless of whether
extension module 2 or 3 is used, and Xm+12 through Xm+14 must be
allocated as a DI work area to enable the use of the MPG.  Therefore, when
using an MPG for the i series CNC, allocate DI addresses in units of 16
bytes.  Do not use the DI space from Xm+12 through Xm+14 for Ladder;
the CNC processes the MPG counter value directly.
DI address Xm+15 is used for detecting overcurrent and overheating
alarms that occur in the IC used in the DO driver.  [For details, see the
section describing the detection of DO (output signal) alarms.]  This
address is fixed regardless of whether extension module 2 or 3 is used, and
it must be allocated as a work area before it can be used.  When using this
area, therefore, allocate DI addresses in units of 16 bytes.
Basically, I/O addresses can be allocated to the connector panel I/O
modules freely.  When allocating DI addresses, however, consider also the
addresses that are directly supervised by the CNC, and keep the following
in mind.

The DO driver of the Basic and Extension module A/B is capable of
detecting an overcurrent and measuring its own temperature.  If an
accident, such as the connecting of the cable to ground, causes an
abnormal increase in the load current or in the driver temperature, a
protection circuit, which is provided for each DO driver (1 byte), is
activated and keeps the DO signal for the relevant 1 byte in the OFF state
until the cause of the problem is eliminated.  Even if this occurs, the CNC
and I/O module continue operating.  The DI address (Xm+15) identifies
the DO driver which has detected the alarm.  The following table shows
the correspondence between the DI address (Xm+15) bits and the DO
addresses.  Bit value “1” indicates that the corresponding DO driver has
detected an alarm.  The contents of the Xm+15 area can be checked by
using the DGN screen of the CNC or by performing alarm processing for
the area in advance by using Ladder.  This helps alarm detection and
recovery.

Allocation of the 2A output module and analog input module 
The 2A output module and analog input module can be allocated to any
of the spaces for expansion modules 1, 2, and 3.  In addition, up to three
2A output modules or analog input modules can be allocated to all the
spaces for expansion modules 1, 2, and 3.  When an MPG interface is
required, the module occupies the space for expansion module 1; no 2A
output module or analog input module can be allocated in the space for
expansion module 1.
The 2A output module does not involve DI points, so that the DI area of
the space in which a 2A output module is allocated is unusable.  When a
2A output module is allocated to the space for expansion module 2, for
example, the areas from Xm+6 to Xm+8 cannot be used.  (The spaces for
the other modules are not shifted.  In this case, the DI space of expansion
module 3 remains at Xm+9 through Xm+11.)

NOTE
Xm+1.0 through Xm+1.7 are DI pins for which a common
voltage can be selected.  That is, by connecting the COM1
CE54(A02) pin to the +24 V power supply, a DI signal can
be input with its logical state reversed.  If, however, a cable
is connected to ground, it has the same effect as inputting
an ON state DI signal.  To prevent this from occurring, the
connection of the COM1 CE54(A02) pin to the 0 V power
supply is recommended whereever possible.
For safety reasons, the emergency stop signal needs to be
allocated to an appropriate bit of the addresses for which
the common voltage is fixed, ranging from Xm+0.0 to
Xm+0.7.  See “Address allocation” in Section 9.5.10 for
details of how to allocate the emergency stop signal.
For unused DI pins allocated to the addresses for which the
common voltage is fixed (from Xm+1.0 to Xm+1.7), the logic
is fixed to “0”.  For unused pins allocated to Xm+1.0 to
Xm+1.7 for which the common voltage can be selected, the
logic is fixed to “0” when the COM1 CE54(A02) pin is
connected to the 0 V power supply.  When the COM1
CE54(A02) pin is connected to the +24 V power supply, the
logic is fixed to “1”.  The logic of the unused pins allocated
to Xm+1.0 to Xm+1.7 is variable when the contact of the
COM1 CE54(A02) pin is open.

If a system alarm occurs in the CNC using the operator’s panel I/O
module, or if I/O Link communication between the CNC and operator’s
panel I/O module fails, all the DO signals of the I/O module are turned
off.  Therefore, sufficient care is necessary when setting up the machine
sequence.  Also, the same phenomenon occurs if the power to the CNC
or the I/O module is turned off.

For the operator’s panel I/O module, I/O addresses are mapped as follows.

through Xm+14.  These addresses are fixed, and Xm+12 through Xm+14
must be allocated as a DI work area to enable the use of the MPG.
Therefore, when using an MPG for the I series CNC, allocate DI addresses
in units of 16 bytes.  Do not use the DI space from Xm+12 through Xm+14
for Ladder; the CNC processes the MPG counter value directly.

DI address Xm+15 is used for detecting overcurrent and overheating
alarms that may occur in the IC used in the DO driver.  [For details, see
the section describing the detection of DO (output signal) alarms.]  This
address is fixed, and must be allocated as a work area before it can be used.
Therefore, when using this area, allocate DI addresses in units of 16 bytes.

Basically, I/O addresses can be allocated to the operator’s panel I/O
module freely.  When allocating DI addresses, however, consider also the
fixed addresses that are directly supervised by the CNC, and keep the
following in mind.

Although fixed signals such as SKIP cannot be used,

All the DO signals can be turned off simultaneously by turning off
(opening) the DO (output signal) power supply pin “DOCOM”.  Doing
so causes the DO signal status to change as shown below.

NOTE
When the DO signal is in the ON state in the sequence, the
ON or OFF state of the DOCOM pin determines the state of
the signal, as indicated by the dotted lines in the above
figure.  Do not turn off the +24 V supply, provided by the
CPD1 to the I/O module, during the operation.  Turning off
the +24 V supply would cause a CNC communication alarm.
When turning on the power, the +24 V supply to the I/O
module must be turned on before or at the same time as the
power supply to the CNC.  When turning off the power, the
+24 V supply to the I/O module must be turned off after or
at the same time as the power supply to the CNC.

The DO load current can be doubled by connecting two DO points in
parallel and turning them on and off simultaneously in sequence, as
shown in the figure below.  The maximum load current per DI point is 200
mA.  Connecting two DO points in parallel and turning them on at the
same time produces a current of 400 mA.  Note that, however, when two
DO points are connected in parallel, the leakage current also doubles
while they are off (max. 40 mA).

The DO driver of the I/O module is capable of detecting an overcurrent
and measuring its own temperature.  If an accident, such as connecting the
cable to ground, causes an abnormal increase in the load current or in the
driver temperature, a protection circuit, which is provided for each DO
driver (1 byte), is activated which keeps the DO signal for the relevant 1
byte in the OFF state until the cause of the problem is eliminated.  Even
if this occurs, the CNC and the I/O module continue operating.  The DI
address (Xm+15) identifies which DO driver has detected an alarm.  The
following table shows the correspondence between the DI address
(Xm+15) bits and the DO addresses.  Bit value “1” indicates that the
corresponding DO driver has detected an alarm.  The contents of the
Xm+15 area can be checked by using the DGN screen of the CNC or by
performing the alarm processing for the area in advance by using Ladder.
This helps alarm detection and recovery.

NOTE
Xm+0.0 through Xm+0.7 and Xm+5.0 through Xm+5.7 are
DI pins for which a common voltage can be selected.  That
is, by connecting the DICOM0 CE56(A14) or DICOM5
CE57(B14) pin to the +24 V power supply, a DI signal can
be input with its logical state reversed.  If, however, a cable
is connected to ground, it has the same effect as inputting
an ON state DI signal.  To prevent this from occurring, the
connection of the DICOM0 CE56(A14) and DICOM5
CE57(B14) pins to the 0 V power supply is recommended
whereever possible.
For safety reasons, the emergency stop signal needs to be
allocated to an appropriate bit of the addresses for which
the common voltage is fixed.  See “Address allocation” in
Section 9.6.9 for details of how to allocate the emergency
stop signal.
For unused DI pins allocated to the addresses for which the
common voltage is fixed, the logic is fixed to “0”.  For unused
pins allocated to the addresses for which the common
voltage can be selected, the logic is fixed to “0” when the
DICOM0 CE56(A14) or DICOM5 CE57(B14) pin is
connected to the 0 V power supply.  When the DICOM0
CE56(A14) or DICOM5 CE57(B14) pin is connected to the
+24 V power supply, the logic is fixed to “1”.  The logic of the
unused pins is variable when the contacts of the DICOM0
CE56(A14) and DICOM5 CE57(B14) pins are open.

If a system alarm occurs in a CNC using this 48/32–point I/O module, or
if I/O Link communication between the CNC and operator’s panel I/O
module fails, all the DO signals of the I/O module are turned off.
Therefore, due care must be taken when setting up the machine sequence.
Also, the same phenomenon occurs if the power of the CNC or the I/O
module is turned off.

Basically, this 48/32–point I/O module is allocated a group of DI
addresses (16 bytes) and a group of DO addresses (4 bytes).  This address
allocation is explained below.

The MPG interface (MPG counter) occupies DI space from Xm+12
through Xm+14.  These addresses are fixed, and Xm+12 through Xm+14
must be allocated as a DI work area to enable the use of the MPG.
Therefore, when using an MPG for the i series CNC, allocate DI addresses
in units of 16 bytes.  Do not use the DI space from Xm+12 through Xm+14
for Ladder; the CNC processes the MPG counter value directly.

DI address Xm+15 is used for detecting overcurrent and overheating
alarms that occur in the IC used in the DO driver.  [For details, see the
section describing the detection of DO (output signal) alarms.]  This
address is fixed, and must be allocated as a work area before it can be used.
When using this area, therefore, allocate DI addresses in units of 16 bytes.

Basically, I/O addresses can be allocated to the 48/32–point I/O module
freely.  When allocating DI addresses, however, consider also the fixed
addresses that are directly supervised by the CNC, and keep the following
in mind.

*DECn fixed signal

Allocating DI addresses from X0004 allows the fixed signals,
such as SKIP and *DECn, to be used and the *ESP fixed
signal to be allocated to an address for which the common
voltage in fixed to 24 V.

All the DO signals can be turned off simultaneously by turning off
(opening) the DO (output signal) power supply pin “DOCOM”.  Doing
so causes the DO signal status to change as shown below.

NOTE
When the DO signal is in the ON state in the sequence, the
ON or OFF state of the DOCOM pin determines the state of
the signal, as shown within dotted lines in the above figure.
Do not turn off the +24 V supply provided by the CPD1 to the
I/O module during the operation.  Turning off the +24 V
supply causes a CNC communication alarm.  When turning
on the power, the +24 V supply to the I/O module must be
turned on before or at the same time as the power supply
to the CNC.  When turning off the power, the +24 V supply
to the I/O module must be turned off after or at the same time
as the power supply to the CNC.

The DO load current can be doubled by connecting two DO points in
parallel and turning them on and off simultaneously in sequence, as
shown in the figure below.  The maximum load current per DI point is 200
mA.  Connecting two DO points in parallel and turning them on at the
same time produces a current of 400 mA.  Note that, however, when two
DO points are connected in parallel, the leakage current also doubles
when they are off (max. 40 mA).

The DO driver of the I/O module is capable of detecting an overcurrent
and measuring its own temperature.  If an accident, such as the connecting
of the cable to ground, causes an abnormal increase in the load current or
in the driver temperature, a protection circuit, which is provided for each
DO driver (1 byte), is activated and keeps the DO signal for the relevant
1 byte in the OFF state until the cause of the problem is eliminated.  Even
if this occurs, the CNC and I/O module continue operating.  The DI
address (Xm+15) identifies the DO driver which has detected the alarm.
The following table shows the correspondence between the DI address
(Xm+15) bits and the DO addresses.  Bit value “1” indicates that the
corresponding DO driver has detected an alarm.  The contents of the
Xm+15 area can be checked by using the DGN screen of the CNC or by
performing alarm processing for the area in advance by using Ladder.
This helps alarm detection and recovery.

� Two inputs (input voltage:  0 to +10 V)

� Input voltages are converted from analog to digital.  The resulting five
bits of data are sent to the CNC through the FANUC I/O Link.

� The analog signal input function can be used regardless of whether I/O
Link allocation is 128/128 or 256/256.

� Emergency stop and OT release signals are forwarded without change
to the power magnetics cabinet.

� Power ON/OFF control signals are forwarded without change to an
input unit.

� Analog signal inputs described in item “Analog signal  inputs” can be
sent out without being changed.

Pulse information from the manual pulse generator is transferred via an
I/O Link.

When this unit is used together with a unit (connector panel I/O module)
connected to the I/O Link supporting another MPG interface, only the
MPG interface of the unit (module) closest to the CNC connected to the
I/O Link is valid.

� Preventing malfunctions that may be caused by detouring current
When there are three or more matrix DI points, detouring current can
cause a nonexistent DI input to be falsely detected as existing.
As shown below, if KY01, KY03, and KY21 are closed
simultaneously, current detours through the path indicated with
arrows, thus causing a false input of *KY23 to be detected because of
a current path formed by a combination of common signal *KYC2 and
data signal *KYD3.

Two modes are available to prevent this malfunction.  One should be

[Method 1]
� Ignoring all occurrences of three or more simultaneous inputs

Action : Make the *MNDI signal open (see item “� Key switch
addresses”)

NOTE
If there are two inputs and a third is added, all three are
ignored.  When one of the three inputs is removed, two are
accepted.

[Method 2]
� Attaching detour prevention diodes to enable three simultaneous

inputs
Action : Connect the *MNDI signal (see item “� Key switch

addresses”) to 0V.

A diode must be connected in series with a switch, as shown below.

� This PCB can raise a confirmation sound when a key is pressed.  The
condition to raise an audible alarm is set in 8–bit units, or in *KYCn
units.  If *BZMD and common *KYCn are disconnected, a KYnx
input causes a sound to generate.  If they are connected, a KYnx input
does not generate the sound.
To generate a confirmation sound for key input, the DO (PMC address
DO + 00.7) “MD07” must have been turned to “1” (see Subsec.
10.7.5).

1 A diode is necessary to connect *BZMD and *KYCn, as
shown below.

2 This setting cannot be changed when power is supplied.
3 The sound is generated when the circuit closes between

common signal *KYCn and data signal *KYDx.  It does not
sound when the circuit is disconnected.  If key switches are
used, the sound is heard at the moment a key is pressed.
It does not sound when a key is released or when a key is
held pressed.

*BZMD

(Example)
If *BZMD is connected to *KYC0 and *KYC2, but disconnected from
*KYC1 and *KYC3, as shown below, closing a switch at key
addresses KY10 to KY17 and KY30 to KY37 causes a confirmation
sound for key input to be heard, but closing a switch at key addresses
KY00 to KY07 and KY20 to KY27 does not.

WARNING
All signals input to this operator’s panel connection unit are
of source type.
When a source interface is used, a ground fault in an input
signal has the same effect as closing the contacts.  From the
viewpoint of safety, therefore, FANUC does not recommend
the use of such an interface for input signals.  In particular,
input signals X008.0 to X008.7 must be connected in a sink
layout, because these signals include the emergency stop
signal.
Do not use this operator’s panel connection unit for
safety–critical input signals (such as an emergency stop
signal).

Output signals DO00 to DO77 of the operator’s panel connection unit
drive indicators and LEDs on the machine operator’s panel and use NPN

Prepare 24VDC for power supply of indicators and LEDs and connect 0V
to COM3 and COM4.  For LEDs, however, 5VDC 300mA output from
the terminal +5N of the connector CM3 can be used.  There is no +5N in
the connector CM4; use +5N in connector CM3 as shown below:

When a sink output interface is used, a ground fault in an

325

The operator’s panel connection unit (A16B–2202–0730, 0731), which
connects to the control unit via the FANUC I/O Link, acts as an interface
with the machine operator’s panel.
Connectors CM51, CM52, CMB3, and CMB4, used to interface with the
operator’s panel, feature an electrical interface and pin assignment which
are fully compatible with those of the source type output operator’s panel
connection unit for the Series 15.  The following two units are available
with different numbers of I/O points:

Most input signals for the source output type connection unit support a
sink type non–isolated interface.  For some input signals, however, either
sink or source type can be selected.  (European safety standards demand
the use of sink types.)

The machine’s contacts shall conform to the following specifications:

Capacity: 30 VDC, 16 mA or higher
Intercontact leakage current in closed circuit: 

1 mA or less (at 26.4 V)
Intercontact voltage drop in closed circuit:  

2 V or less (including the voltage drop in the cables)

In the above figure, logical 0 corresponds to open contacts, while logical

WARNING
When a source interface is used, a ground fault in an input
signal has the same effect as closing the contacts.  From the
viewpoint of safety, therefore, FANUC does not recommend
the use of such an interface for input signals.

The output signals shall satisfy the following:

Maximum load current when driver is on:
200 mA (including momentary values)

Saturation voltage when driver is on:
1.0 V max. 

Withstand voltage: 24 V +20% (including momentary values)
Leakage current when driver is off:

100 mA

Prepare the following external power supply for the output signals:

Supply voltage: +24 V " 10%
Supply current (per board):

At least total maximum load current 
(including momentary values) + 100 mA 

Power–on timing: At the same time as or before turning on
the power to the control unit

Power–off timing: At the same time as or after turning on the
power to the control unit

328

CAUTION
A power supply which satisfies the above specifications
shall be connected to the DOCOM and 0V power supply
terminals for the output signals.  The maximum current that
can be carried by the DOCOM pin is 2.0 A.  The total load
current must not exceed this value, therefore.

The output signal driver used with the operator’s panel connection unit
can output up to eight signals.

The driver element monitors the current of each output signal.  If an
overcurrent is detected, the output of that signal is turned off.  Once a
signal has been turned off, the overcurrent will no longer exist, such that
the driver turns the signal on again.  Therefore, in the case of a ground fault
or overload, the output of a signal will be repeatedly turned on and off.
This also occurs when a load which causes a high surge current is
connected.

The driver element contains an overheat detector, which turns off all eight
output signals if the temperature in the device exceeds the set value as a
result of an overcurrent caused by a ground fault or some other failure.
This off state is held.  To restore signal output, logically turn the output
off then back on again, for each signal, after the temperature falls below
the set value.  Signal output can also be restored by turning the system
power off then back on again.

On the PCB, a red LED beside the driver element lights once the overheat
detection circuit operates.

NOTE
The overheat detection circuit also causes a system alarm
to be issued to the CNC.  (When setting pins CP1 on the
PCB are closed (jumpered), this alarm is not issued to the
CNC.)

NOTE
The above red LED and alarm transfer to the CNC are
supported by PCBs of version 03B and later.

If the output of a signal cannot be turned on even though the CNC
diagnostic indicates that the signal is on, that signal or another signal
being handled by the same element may be overloaded, thus causing the
eight output signals to be turned off.  In such a case, turn the system power
off and eliminate the cause of the overload.

NOTE
This system enables I/O data transfer between two independent FANUC I/O Link master
devices.  When the system is adjusted and maintained, the FANUC I/O Link can be operated
with the system power for one of the FANUC I/O Link lines switched off, that is, the link operation
is stopped.  In this case, DI data sent from a system at rest consists entirely of zeros.  If one
of the links is stopped, either abnormally or normally, it takes up to several hundred milliseconds
for this function to take effect.  During this period, that data which exists immediately before the
link stops is sent out.  Take this into account when designing your system.

I/O Link function Provided with two slave mode I/O Link interface channels,
between which DI/DO data can be transferred.

[Interface types]
One of the following combinations is selected:

Electrical – optical
Electrical – electrical
Optical – optical

Number of DI/DO
data items

DI:  Up to 256,  DO:  Up to 256
(The number of data items actually used varies depending
on the amount of data assigned in the host.)

Power supply Each I/O Link interface must be independently supplied with
+24 VDC.

Voltage:  +24 VDC +10%, –15%
Current:  0.2 A (excluding surge)

If a master unit does not have sufficient capacity to supply
power to each unit (0.2 A per slot), use an external power
supply unit.  The power supply must be switched on, either
simultaneously with or before, the I/O Link master.
The two systems can be switched on and off independently
of each other.  Data from a system to which no power is
supplied appears as zeros when viewed from the other
system.  The data becomes 0 within 200 ms of the power
being  switched off.

The FANUC servo unit β series with I/O Link (called the β amplifier with
I/O Link) is a power motion control servo unit that can be easily connected
to a CNC control unit via the FANUC I/O Link.
The β amplifier with I/O Link can be connected to the i Series using the
FANUC I/O Link.

NOTE
Using the β amplifier requires that the power mate CNC
manager software function be installed in the i Series.  This
function is included as one of the i Series option functions.
Note that this function is not supported by the i Series with
personal computer functions also requires an optional CNC
screen display function.

The maximum number of β amplifiers with I/O Link that can be
connected to a control unit depends on the maximum number of FANUC
I/O Link points provided by that control unit, as well as their assignments.
For the i Series, the maximum number of FANUC I/O Link DI and DO
points are 1024 and 1024, respectively.  One β amplifier with I/O Link
occupies 128 DI/DO points in the FANUC I/O Link.  If no units other than
the β amplifiers with I/O Link are connected to the control unit, up to eight
β amplifiers can be connected.

If the β amplifier with I/O Link is used as an I/O Link slave, I/O addresses
are assigned in the PMC in the CNC.  Because data output from the slave
is made in 16–byte units, the number of input/output points must be set
to 128.

The module names are PM16I (input) and PM16O (output).
The BASE is always 0, and the SLOT is 1.

NOTE
1 Xm+1.0 to Xm+1.7 and Xm+3.0 to Xm+3.7 are DI points that

allows common selection.  This means that by connecting
the DICOM1 pin (CM58–A02) and DICOM3 pin
(CM58–B02) to +24 V, the DI signal whose logic is inverted
can be applied.  In this case, however, if the cable is struck
by lightning, it has the effect of turning on the DI signal.  For
safety reasons, therefore, the connection of the DICOM1
and DICOM3 pins to 0 V is recommended whenever
possible.

2 From the viewpoint of safety, an emergency stop signal
needs to assigned to the corresponding bit of addresses
Xm+2.0 to Xm+2.7 tied to the common signal.  Determine
the location of an emergency stop signal as described in
Section 10.12.12.

3 The unused DI points of addresses Xm+2.0 to Xm+2.7 tied
to the common signal are used as inputs tied to 0.  The
unused DI points of addresses Xm+1.0 to Xm+1.7 and
Xm+3.0 to Xm+3.7 that allow common selection are input
signals tied to 0 when the DICOM1 pin (CM58–A02) and
DICOM3 pin (CM58–B02) are connected to 0 V; the unused
DI points are input signals  tied to 1 when the DICOM1 pin
(CM58–A02) and DICOM3 pin (CM58–B02) are connected
to +24 V.  When the DICOM1 pin (CM58–A02) and DICOM3
pin (CM58–B02) are open, the logic of the unused DI points
at addresses Xm+1.0 to Xm+1.7 and Xm+3.0 to Xm+3.7 is
undefined.

With the distribution I/O machine operator’s panel,  basically allocate a
group of 16 bytes as a DI area, and allocate a group of 8 bytes as a DO area.
The reason for this is described below.  The MPG interface (MPG counter)
uses Xm+12 through Xm+14 of the DI space.  These addresses are fixed.
Xm+12 through Xm+14 must be allocated before the MPG interfaces can
be used.  So, when using MPG interfaces with the i series, allocate a group
of 16 bytes as a DI area.  The value of an MPG counter is directly
processed by the CNC, so the ladder must not use this area.
When MPG interfaces are not used, the DI area may be allocated to other
I/O groups.

The keyboard of the machine operator’s panel employs a matrix
configuration.  If three or more keys are simultaneously entered in the
matrix DI configuration, a DI signal is erroneously entered due to an
abnormal current flow.  A countermeasure for this malfunction can be
implemented using a ladder program.

(Protection against malfunction)

If three or more keys are entered in the matrix DI configuration, all key
inputs after the first two are invalidated.  If there are no additional key
inputs after three or more invalidated key inputs, and if the total number
of inputs is two or less, all key inputs that have been performed up to that
time are valid.

(Ladder operation)
The following provides examples of ladder operation based on the DI
matrix of 8 (bits)   8 (common), indicated on the next page.

(1)The number of data lines where keys are entered is checked.
The OR (R1) of the data of all the addresses is found.  Among the eight
bits of the R1 data, the number of bits set to 1 represents the number
of data lines where keys are entered.

1 The R1 data is compared with 00h.  If a match is found, the number
of R1 data bits set to 1 is 0.

Example)  State (a): R1 = (00000000)  ‡   
The number of data lines where keys are entered is 0.

2 The R1 data is compared with the data tables below.  If the R1 data
matches the data in data table 1, the number of R1 data bits set to
1 is 1.  Similarly, if the R1 data matches the data in data table 2, the
number of R1 data bits set to 1 is 2.

Example)  State (b) or (c):  R1 = (00000100)  ‡   
The number of data lines where keys are entered is 1.

Example)  State (d) or (e):  R1 = (00010100)  ‡   
The number of lines where keys are entered is 2.

3 If the R1 data is not 00h, and does not match the data of either data
table, the number of R1 data bits set to 1 is 3 or more.

Example)  State (f):  R1 = (00110100)  ‡   
The number of lines where keys are entered is 3.

00000001 00000010

00000100 00001000

Data table 1 Data table 2

(2)Decision 1

1 When there is no line where keys are entered
‡   No key switch is pressed.  

Example)  State (a)

2  When there are two or less lines where keys are entered
‡   Go to (3)

3  When there are three or more lines where keys are entered
‡   Three or more keys are entered.  This case is invalid.

Example)  State (f)



B–63003EN/03 10. CONNECTION TO FANUC I/O Link

367

(3)When there are two or less data lines where keys are entered, whether
multiple keys are entered on a data line is checked.
The data of all addresses are subtracted from the OR (R1) to obtain
result R2.  When R2 = 00h, there is no data line where multiple keys
are entered.

Example) When there is one data line where a key is entered
State (b):  R2 = FCh
State (c):  R2 = F8h

When there are two data lines where keys are entered
State (d):  R2 = 00h
State (e):  R2 = FCh

(4)Decision 2

1 When R2 = 00h

‡ There are two or less data lines where keys are entered, and no
multiple keys are entered on a data line.  In this case, the total
number of keys entered is 1 or 2, thus representing valid key
input.  
Example)  State (d)

2 When R2 0  00h

‡ There are two or less data lines where keys are entered, and
multiple keys are entered on a data line.  Go to (5).

(5)Decision 3

1 When there is one data line where keys are entered  ‡   Go to (6).

2 When there are two data lines where keys are entered

‡ Three or more keys are entered, thus representing invalid key
input.  
Example)  State (e)

(6)The result of subtraction (R2) is added to the OR (R1).  When the result
of addition is 00h, the total number of keys entered is 2.

Example) State (b):  R1 + R2 = 04h + FCh = 00h
State (c):  R1 + R2 = 04h + F8h = FCh

(7)Decision 4

1 When R1 + R2 = 00h

‡ There is one data line where keys are entered, and two keys are
entered on the data line.  This means that the total number of
keys entered is 2, representing valid key input.
Example)  State (b)

2 R1 + R2 0  00h

‡ Three or more keys are entered on a data line, thus representing
invalid key input.
Example)  State (c)

(8)Only when valid key input is confirmed by decisions 1 through 4, all
DI data (Xm+4 to Xm+11) is used by the ladder program.

B–63003EN/03 11. EMERGENCY STOP SIGNAL

377

11 EMERGENCY STOP SIGNAL
Using the emergency stop signal effectively enables the design of safe
machine tools.
The emergency stop signal is provided to bring a machine tool to an
emergency stop.  It is input to the CNC controller, servo amplifier, and
spindle amplifier.  An emergency stop signal is usually generated by
closing the B contact of a pushbutton switch.
When the emergency stop signal (*ESP) contact is closed, the CNC
controller enters the emergency stop released state, such that the servo and
spindle motors can be controlled and operated.
When the emergency stop signal (*ESP) contact opens, the CNC
controller is reset and enters the emergency stop state, and the servo and
spindle motors are decelerated to a stop.
Shutting off the servo amplifier power causes a dynamic brake to be
applied to the servo motor.  Even when a dynamic brake is applied,
however, a servo motor attached to a vertical axis can move under the
force of gravity.  To overcome this problem, use a servo motor with a
brake.
While the spindle motor is running, shutting off the motor–driving power
to the spindle amplifier allows the spindle motor to continue running
under its own inertia, which is quite dangerous.  When the emergency stop
signal (*ESP) contact opens, it is necessary to confirm that the spindle
motor has been decelerated to a stop, before the spindle motor power is
shut off.
The FANUC servo amplifier α series products are designed to satisfy the
above requirements.  The emergency stop signal should be input to the
power supply module (called the PSM).  The PSM outputs a motor power
MCC control signal, which can be used to switch the power applied to the
power supply module on and off.
The CNC controller is designed to detect overtravel by using a software
limit function.  Normally, no hardware limit switch is required to detect
overtravel.  If the machine goes beyond a software limit because of a servo
feedback failure, however, it is necessary to provide a stroke end limit
switch, connected so that the emergency stop signal can be used to stop
the machine.
Fig. 11 shows an example showing how to use the emergency stop signal
with this CNC controller and α series control amplifier.

WARNING
To use a spindle motor and amplifier produced by a manufacturer other than FANUC, refer to
the corresponding documentation as well as this manual.  Design the emergency stop
sequence such that, if the emergency stop signal contact opens while the spindle motor is
rotating, the spindle motor is decelerated until it stops.

13 HIGH–SPEED SERIAL BUS (HSSB)



13. HIGH–SPEED SERIAL BUS (HSSB) B–63003EN/03

390

The high–speed serial bus (HSSB) enables the high–speed transfer of
large amounts of data between a commercially available IBM PC or
compatible personal computer and a CNC, by connecting them via a
high–speed optical fiber.
On the CNC, the HSSB interface board is installed in a minislot.  On the
personal computer, an appropriate interface board is installed.

The use of the HSSB requires an IBM PC/AT compatible computer or
FANUC intelligent terminal.  The machine tool builder or end user is
required to procure and maintain the personal computer.
To enable the use of the HSSB, Windows 95 or Windows NT must have
been installed on the personal computer.
FANUC owns the copyright for the HSSB device driver.
The software mentioned above and the contents of the related manuals
may not be used or reproduced in part or whole without the prior written
permission of FANUC.

NOTE
1 IBM is a registered trademark of IBM Corp. of the US.
2 Windows 95 are registered trademarks of Microsoft Corp. of

the US.

CAUTION
1 The machine tool builder or end user is required to procure

and maintain the personal computer.
2 FANUC is not liable for any problems resulting from the

operation of users’ personal computers, regardless of
whether the operations are normal or abnormal.

(1)The personal computer interface board complies with the ISA
standard.  It can be used in the PC/AT and compatibles.  (The CPU of
the personal computer must be a 486 or better.

(2)The following address space is used to control the high–speed serial
bus.  This space cannot be used by other functions or extension boards.

� 16 bytes of ISA I/O space corresponding to the addresses specified
with the setting switch, as explained in Section 13.6

(3)The connections between the selected personal computer and CNC
controller should be tested before they are used for actual production.

(4)The personal computer interface boards require as below.

1ch +5V, 1A

2ch +5V, 1.5A

WARNING
Before starting to mount or remove a personal computer
interface board, switch off the personal computer and its
peripheral devices, and disconnect their power supply
cables.  Otherwise, there is a serious danger of electric
shock.

(1)Set the I/O addresses before installing the board.  Set I/O base
addresses which do not overlap the I/O address areas exclusively used
by the personal computer and ISA expansion board.  (See the figure
below.)
When using multiple personal computer interface boards, set the I/O
base addresses so that those addresses do not overlap each other.

(2)Remove the blank panel from the expansion slot of the personal
computer.

(3) Insert the interface board.  Ensure that it has been completely inserted
into the ISA connector.

(4)Fix the metal brackets with screws.

CAUTION
Do NOT touch the edge terminals (the contacts that engage
with a mating connector) of the interface board.

This section provides supplementary information about the
recommended (FANUC–approved) 20–pin interface connectors used
with the following target model.

FANUC i series

Models: PCR–EV20MDT (Honda Tsushin)
52618–2011 (Molex Japan)

These board–mounted connectors have been specially developed to
achieve the high packing density required for FANUC products.  As
explained in the following subsection, Honda PCR series connectors can
be used as cable connectors because the mating mechanism of the newly
developed connectors is compatible with that of the Honda PCR series
connectors.  To support this specification extensively, many connector
manufacturers are now developing custom–tailored cable connectors.
(Note that these cables cannot be used with screw–fixing cable connector
housings.)

Models: PCR–E20MDK–SL–A (Honda Tsushin)(straight connector)
PCR–E20LMDETZ–SL (Honda Tsushin)
(right–angled connector)

These connectors are used for the main and option boards of the i series.
As cable connectors, they are compatible with screw–fixing connector
housings as well as the spring locking connector housings.

Strand wire press–mount connector :
With this connector, #28AWG wires are
press–connected to each pin at the same time.
The cost of producing a cable/connector
assembly with this connector model is much
lower than with connectors designed for
crimping or soldering.  
Also, the following connector housing has
been newly developed for use with the i
series.

ÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂHas the same number of pins as the FI40–20S, but features a wider soldering pitch,
facilitating soldering and enabling the use of thicker wires.  Its reinforced pins allow
wires as thick as #17AWG to be soldered to the FI40B–20S (wires no thicker than
#20AWG can be used with the FI40A–20S).  Note, however, that a thick wire, such
as #17AWG, should be used with a more robust housing like the FI–20–CV6.

Features a wider soldering pitch, attained by using the space provided by thinning
out some pins.  Also features tougher pins, compared with its predecessor, the
FI40–2015S.  These pins can be soldered to wires as thick as #17AWG, provided
that the cable diameter does not exceed 8.5 mm.

*1 Cable A66L–0001–0286 has been recommended for use as a pulse coder cable.  It can be

up to 20 m long.  Two cables, A66L–0001–0402 and A66L–0001–0403, have recently been
developed.  A66L–0001–0402 and A66L–0001–0403 can be as long as 30 m and 50 m,
respectively.  (See Fig. 4 for detailed specifications.)
Both cables have the same level of oil and bending resistance (cable, 100 mm in diameter,
capable of withstanding at least 10 million bending cycles) as conventional cables, and are
UL– and CSA–certified.

2. Cable selection
� Always use an external cable (A66L–6001–0026#) when the cable

is to be laid outside the power magnetics cabinet or main unit
cabinet, where it may be pulled, rubbed, or stepped on.

� Use an external cable when part of the cabling is to be subject to
movement.  For example, when connecting a portable

ÂÂÂ
 operation

pendant box to the power magnetics cabinet, the use of an external
cable is desirable because the cable is likely to be bent, pulled, or
twisted repeatedly even though frequent system operation is not
expected.  However, the force likely to be applied when the cable
is installed or moved for maintenance purposes does not need to be
taken into consideration.

� Use an external cable in locations where sparks or flame are a
danger.  Although the internal cord type cable
(A66L–6001–0023#) is covered by nonflammable resin, the cover,
if exposed to frame for a long time, may melt, allowing the fiber
cable inside to burn.

� Use an external cable when the cable is expected to be pulled with
considerable force during installation (the force applied to the cable
must be within the specified tensile strength limit at all times).  For
example, even though installing a cable in a cable duct can be
regarded as internal cabling, a cable of the appropriate type must
be selected according to the tensile force to be applied to the cable
during installation.

� Both the internal cord type and external cables have the same oil
and heat resistance properties.

3. Procuring the cable
All the optical fiber cables mentioned above are special cable products
with optical connectors, which are designed, produced, and tested to
ensure the required system performance and reliability.  It is
technically impossible for users to produce these cables or process (cut
and reconnect) them after purchase.  Users are requested to purchase
cables of the necessary length from an appropriate supplier.  Cables are
available from either FANUC or any of the FANUC–approved
manufacturers listed in Table D.2.

4. Handling precautions

(1)Protection during storage
When the electrical/optical conversion module mounted on the
printed circuit board and the optical fiber cable are not in use, their
mating surfaces must be protected with the lid and caps with which
they are supplied.  If left uncovered, the mating surfaces are likely
to become dirty, possibly resulting in a poor cable connection.

Optical fiber cable

Fig. D.3  Protection of electrical/optical conversion module and optical fiber cable (when not in use)

(2)Optical fiber cable
• Although the reinforcing cover of the external cable has sufficient

mechanical strength, be careful not to drop heavy objects on the
cable.

• Grasp the optical connector firmly when connecting or
disconnecting the cable.  Do not pull on the optical fiber cord itself.
(The maximum tensile strength between the fiber cord and
connector is 2 kg.  Applying greater force to the cord is likely to
cause the connector to come off, making the cable unusable.)

• Once connected, the optical connector is automatically locked by
the lock levers on its top.  To remove the connector, release the lock
levers and pull the connector.

• Although optical connectors cannot be connected in other than the
correct orientation, always take note of the connector’s orientation
before making the connection.

• Before installing an external cable, fix either a wire with a hook or
a tension member to the reinforcing cover of the optical connector
and pull the wire or tension member, as shown in Fig. D.4.  This
is done to prevent a tensile force from being applied between the
fiber cord and connector.  If no tensile force is applied between the
fiber cord and connector when installing the cable, you can hold the
reinforcing cover of the connector directly and pull it.  In the case
of an internal cord, which does not have a reinforcing cover, apply
the same protective measures, as instructed in Fig. D.4, for that
portion of the cable where the two cords are bound together, in
order to prevent a tensile force from being applied between the fiber
cord and connector.  In the same way as for an external cable, if no
tensile force is applied between the fiber cord and connector during
installation, you can hold the shielded part of the cable directly and
pull it.  Because the combined tensile strength of the two cords is
only 14 kg, however, avoid applying too great a force to the cable
during installation, regardless of whether you have taken the
protective measures.

Fig. D.4  Prior to installing a cable

� Take care to keep both parts of the optical connector (cable side and
PCB side) clean.  If they become dirty, wipe them with tissue paper or
absorbent cotton to remove dirt.  The tissue paper or absorbent cotton
may be moistened with ethyl alcohol.  Do not use any organic solvent
other than ethyl alcohol.

� Fix the reinforcing cover of the external cable or the cord binding
portion of the internal cord type cable by using a cable clamp, as
shown in Fig. D.5, to prevent the weight of the optical fiber cable
from being applied directly to the connecting part of the optical
connector.

(Recommended cable clamp):  
Recommended cable clamps are listed below.  Use a clamp
that grasps the optical cable lightly; the clamp should not
apply excessive pressure to the cable.

Fig. D.5  Fixing the cable with a clamp

� Any superfluous portion of the cable may be wound into a loops.
Should this prove necessary, make sure the diameter of each loop
is at least 150 mm (for an external cable) or at least 100 mm (for
an internal cord type cable).  Winding the cable into smaller loops
may produce sharp curves that exceed the specified bending radius
limit without the user being aware.  Such bending can result in a
greater transmission loss, ultimately leading to a communication
failure.

� When using a nylon band (cable tie) as a cable clamp, follow the
instructions given below.  Also, take care not to apply a bending
force to one particular part of the cable when fixing it with a clamp.
Failing to clamp the cable correctly may cut or damage it.
External cable:
Do not clamp the uncovered portion of the cable with a nylon band.
When clamping the cable by the reinforcing cover, the clamping
force is not an important factor to consider.  However, ensure that
the clamping force is as small as possible to ensure that the
reinforcing cover is not deformed by the clamping.  If possible, the
clamping force should be 5 kg or less.
Internal cord type cable:
Lightly clamp the optical cable with a nylon band so that the cable
shield is not deformed.  If possible, the clamping force should be
1 or 2 kg (make sure that no force is applied to the cable).  Due care
is required when clamping the internal cord type cable because its
cable shield is weaker than the reinforcing cover of the external
cable.

5. Compatibility with previous models of FANUC optical fiber cables
FANUC has offered other types of optical cables for different
applications (see Table D.3).
Note that the optical cables for FANUC I/O Link and FANUC
ÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂhigh–speed serial bus applications cannot be used for the servoÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂ
interface application.  On the other hand, however, the external opticalÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂ
cable for the servo interface application can be used in place ofÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂprevious cables types, as shown in Table D.4.
ÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂ

  (The external optical

cable for the servo interface application is designed to offer a level of
performance equivalent to that of the previous cables.  This is not the
case with the internal cord type cable, so it cannot replace the previous
cables.)

7. Precautions for connection with low–loss optical junction adapter

� Features of and handling precautions for low–loss optical junction
adapter (A63L–0020–0004)
When optical connectors for a conventional optical junction
adapter (A63L–0020–0002) are jointed, the facing ferrules(Note 1)
are located about 60 um from each other.  This is because the optical
fiber of conventional PCF (plastic clad silica fiber) cables
(A66L–6001–0008, –0009, –0026) may protrude from the tip of
the ferrules (by up to about several um), resulting in the fiber
protrusion being damaged when the ferrules are butted against each
other.
In the low–loss optical junction adapter, the ferrules are butted
against each other, thus greatly reducing the reduction in repeater
loss.  Therefore, the two optical cables used with the low–lossÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂoptical junction adapters must be dedicated to the adapters.
ÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂIf a conventional PCF (plastic clad silica fiber) cable
(A66L–6001–0008, –0009, –0026) is used as even one of the two
optical fiber cables for joining the low–loss optical junction
adapter, both cables may be damaged, resulting in  deteriorated
characteristics.

NOTE
Ferrule:  Movable metal at the tip of an optical connector; the
fiber is bonded to the ferrule.

� Features of low–loss optical cable (A66L–6001–0029)
A low–loss optical cable is selected from conventional PCF optical
cables (A66L–6601–0026).  The selected cable offers low loss, and
its connector section is given special treatment; the fiber ends are
provided with a depression so that the ferrules can be butted against
each other.  The two optical cables used with the low-loss optical
junction adapter must be of low–loss type.

� Appearance of the low–loss optical junction adapter and cable
(how to distinguish them from conventional types)
The body of the conventional optical junction adapter is black, but
that of the low–loss optical junction adapter is blue.  In addition,
the protective cover(Note 1) of the conventional PCF optical cable
is black, but that of the low–loss optical cable is blue.



D. OPTICAL FIBER CABLE B–63003EN/03

8. Installing the optical fiber junction adapter
The optical fiber junction adapter should be installed within a cabinet,
as a rule.  If it is impossible to avoid installing it within a cabinet,
protect the adapter and the optical cable portions (such as connectors
and cords) not covered with reinforcement coating from the outside air
by, for example, covering them with packing.

9. Environmental resistance of the optical fiber junction adapter

� The optical fiber junction adapter is not waterproof.  Even when
optical cables are attached to both ends of the adapter, there are very
small gaps in the linked portions, so water resistance can not be
expected.

� When optical cables are attached to both ends of the junction
adapter installed in a normal environment (such as within a
cabinet), it is unlikely that dust will penetrate  between the adapter
and optical fiber to the degree that it may hamper normal optical
linkage.  If one or both ends of the adapter are left open, dust and
dirt may accumulate even when the adapter is in a normal
environment (such as within a cabinet).  The dust and dirt on the
adapter ends is likely to hamper normal optical linkage when the
optical cables are attached.  In such a case, clean the junction
adapter and the optical connector using the optical fiber junction
adapter cleaning method described below.

� Do not allow cutting fluid to splash over the adapter or those optical
cable portions (such as connectors and cords) that are not covered
with reinforcement coating.  If the inside of the adapter and fiber
end surfaces are contaminated with cutting fluid, a malfunction
may occur.

10.Cleaning
If the optical fiber junction adapter, optical–to–electrical conversion
module, or optical cable are soiled, clean them according to the
following procedures.

� Cleaning the optical fiber junction adapter and optical-to-electrical
conversion module
First, clean the entire housing by wiping it with a cloth moistened
with, or by washing it in, ethyl alcohol or HCFC141B (alternative
CFC; High Shower spray can DS–2168, manufactured by Sun
Hayato).  Similarly, wash the two sleeves in the adapter or wipe
them with a cotton swab or the like.



B–63003EN/03 D. OPTICAL FIBER CABLE

499

� Cleaning optical cables
For the optical cables, it is important to clean the connectors at their
ends.  Any soiling on the optical fiber end surfaces will hamper
optical transmission, resulting in a malfunction.  Wipe the optical
fiber end surfaces (that is, the ferrule end surfaces) thoroughly with
a soft, clean cloth (like gauze) moistened with ethyl alcohol or
HCFC141B, in the same way as described above.  The use of cotton
swabs may prove convenient.  The fiber end surfaces of low–loss
optical cables are lower than the ferrules.  To remove any soiling
from the fiber end surfaces completely, push the cotton swab or
gauze into the depressions all the way through while rotating the
ferrule.  If the ferrules and optical connectors are contaminated
with oily substances, and they may extend over a cleaned fiber end
surface when it is attached to the optical-to-electrical conversion
module, it is a good idea to wash them before wiping the optical
fiber end surfaces, using the procedure stated above.

When the ambient temperature is low, the brightness of the LCD
decreases.  (In particular, the LCD screen immediately after power–on is
dark.)  This is not a failure but a property of the LCD.  As the ambient
temperature rises, the LCD screen becomes brighter.
The monochrome LCD provides a function for adjusting its brightness.
For an explanation of how to adjust the brightness, refer to the
maintenance manual or operator’s manual of the i Series.

The touch panel is operated by directly touching the LCD screen.  For
touch panel operation, be sure to use the FANUC–supplied pen
(A02B–0236–K111) provided with the touch panel.  If the LCD screen is
touched using a sharp–tipped pen, the surface of the LCD screen may be
damaged.  Moreover, the LCD screen must not be touched by with your
fingers.  Otherwise, the operability may be degraded, and the screen is
likely to become dirty.

A protection sheet is attached the face of an LCD with a touch panel to
protect the thin film of the touch panel and LCD.  The protection sheet is
itself covered by a film to protect against damage in transit.  After
connecting the CNC to the machine, peel off the film as shown below.
The protection film is less transparent, so the display screen will be less
visible if the protection film is not removed.

Protection film

When replacing the protection sheet, use the procedure below.

� Remove the protection sheet from the front of the LCD.  Then, wipe
away any moisture or oil from the front of the LCD.

� Peel off the white backing sheet from the back (side which attaches to
the LCD) of a new protection sheet.

� When the white protection sheet is removed, the protection sheet is
ready to be applied.  Attach the protection sheet onto the front of the
LCD.  At this time, do not allow dirt and dust to enter between the LCD
and protection sheet.

Flash memory card
With the i Series incorporating personal computer functions, no flash
memory card can be used.  With the i Series, Intel series 2 flash memory
cards (or equivalent) can be used.  However, flash memory cards
operating only on a power supply voltage of 3.3 V cannot be inserted
physically.  Such flash memory cards cannot be used.
Basically, flash memory cards with non–Intel on–chip flash memories
cannot be used.  However, such flash memory cards, if formatted or
written by a personal computer, may be read with the i Series.  The
operation of the following FANUC–recommended flash memory card has
been confirmed by FANUC:

B–63003EN/03 F. MEMORY CARD INTERFACE

503

The capacity of a memory card usually indicates an unformatted capacity.
After formatting, the usable capacity decreases slightly.  So, a memory
card with a capacity larger than the size of data and programs actually
stored needs to be prepared.

Example:When the size of data to be stored is 512KB
A memory card with a capacity of 1MB or more is required.

When a flash memory card is used, the last 128KB of the memory card
is used as a buffer area, so that the usable space decreases additionally by
128KB.

The BOOT SYSTEM formats a memory card using method called the
FAT file system.  The formatting method called the flash file system is
also supported.  However, the FAT file system and flash file system are
not compatible with each other, and the read and list functions cannot be
used.

Flash memory cards do not allow individual files to be deleted; all the files
on a flash memory card need to be deleted at the same time.  Accordingly,
the following operations cannot be performed:
� Deletion of an existing file
� Renaming of a file
� Overwriting of a file

CardPro uses the flash file system as standard to format a flash memory
card.  When using CardPro to format a flash memory card used with the
boot system, use the following command to format the card.

ÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂ

ÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂ

A memory card has an insertion guide to protect against reverse insertion.
Pay attention to the orientation of the memory card.  The front of the
memory card must face the LCD of the i Series.

The batteries used with FANUC–supplied SRAM memory cards were of
the CR2325 and BR2325 types.
These batteries were difficult to obtain, so the CR2025 battery was
introduced to replace these batteries in May, 1997.
By replacing the battery holder, the user can use SRAM memory cards
that used the previous batteries (CR2325 and BR2325) with the new
battery (CR2025).

1. Overview

Memory card–based data input/output in the current   Series CNC can
be done only with a flash memory card.  For those models shipped
from FANUC in and after October 1998, however, a flash ATA card
(5 V version) can also be used for data input/output.  Because the flash
ATA card incorporates a storage device and controller, it enables data
input/output for a personal computer equipped with a PCMCIA
interface without using any special PC card writer.

2. Supported hardware versions and software editions
On models other than the FS20i, the following conditions must be

1) HDD signal (CNH3)
In the current Pentium version, the HDD signal connector (CNH1 or
CNH2) is provided for the 2.5″ HDD. When there is a PC separate
wiring unit, this connector is connected to; when there is no PC
separate wiring unit, the main board is connected to.
In the MMX–Pentium version, a 3.5″ HDD is used, and CNH3 on the
main board is connected to at all times.

2) HDD signal (CN2B)
Power is supplied to the 3.5″ HDD currently used in the
MMX–Pentium version by a power cable. (For the 2.5″ HDD
currently used in the current Pentium version, a power line is contained
in the signal cable.) Connect the power cable to CN2B on the main
board.

3) Fan motor for HDD unit (CN39)
In the MMX–Pentium version, a fan motor is used as a heat
countermeasure. Connect the cables coming from the fan unit
mounted on the HDD unit or the PC separate wiring unit to CN39 on
the main board.

The figures on the following page onwards show the external dimensions
of the units for the MMX–Pentium version and the panel cut dimensions.
In these figures, space [A] should be ensured for improving the flow of
air, and space [B] should be ensured if necessary for wiring cables and
connectors. It is also desirable that space [B] be provided for improving
the flow of air. Space [C] may sometimes be necessary as space for wiring
cables and connectors depending on the ISA expansion board in use by
MTB.
