Introduction 
This specification guide provides technical details for the following digital servo systems: 

α Series 

β Series 

βis Series 

αi Series 

α HVi, β HVi and βi Series servos can be mixed in the same system and/or on the same DSM324i 
controller module and use the same FSSB fiber optic interface as the βi Series servos. 

For feature comparisons and information on related products, refer to the Motion Solutions Products 
Catalog, GFA-483. 

Part I, α Series 
The α Series amplifiers can communicate with a wide variety of GE Fanuc controllers, including the 
Power Mate D, Power Mate H, and DSM 300 Series, plus many of the GE Fanuc CNC systems using 
a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) interface. The PWM interface uses the standard GE Fanuc digital 
servo communication protocol. 

A motor protection level of IP65 is standard with all α Series motors, and optional IP67 sealing is 
available on most α Series motors. Torque ratings of 6 to 40 Nm are available on α Series motors.

2.2 α Series Motor–Torque Curves   
The curves shown below illustrate the relationship between the speed of the motor and the output torque. 
The motor can operate continuously at any combination of speed and torque within the prescribed 
continuous operating zone. The limit of the continuous operating zone is determined with the motor’s 
ambient temperature at 40°C and its drive current as pure sine wave. Actual operation is limited by the 
current of the servo drive unit.

2.3 α Series motor holding brake 
Any of the servo motors can be ordered with a holding brake. The brake is used to prevent movement on 
horizontal axes or falling along the vertical axis when the servo motor control is turned off. 

Brakes are spring-set and electrically released and are designed for holding stationary loads only. Using 
the holding brake to stop a moving axis may damage the motor or severely reduce its service life. 

The specifications of the built-in brakes are listed in Table 6HI-2:

2.4 α SVU Series Servo Amplifiers 
The α SVU Series amplifiers must be matched to the corresponding α Series motor. Because motor 
characteristics are closely related to amplifier ratings, GE Fanuc restricts the allowable motor/amplifier 
combinations to those shown in Table  9HI-3 below. 

GE Fanuc offers α SVU Series amplifiers either separately, for replacement and spare parts, or as 
preconfigured packages that include the connectors and spare fuses necessary for most new 
installations. The catalog numbers for both options and package contents are shown in the following

Most of the α Series servo motors can be ordered with IP67 Sealing. Motors with the IP67 Sealing meet 
the IEC standards regarding protection from solid objects and water, as described below: 

Standard IP6x: Protection from Solid Objects 

 Protected against solid objects greater than 1 mm thickness or diameter 
 Dust tight. “No ingress of dust.” 

 

Standard IPx7: Protection from Water 

 Protected against dripping water, rate equivalent to 3–5 mm of rain per minute

 Protected from harmful damage due to water jets, according to the following test: 
  

• Spray from all angles of 12.5 liters/minute (3.3 gal/min) 
• Nozzle diameter = 6.3 mm (0.248 in) 
• Pressure = 30 kN/m2 (0.3 bar)  
• Distance = 3 m (118 in) 
• Duration = 3 minutes 
 

 Protected from harmful Protected against the effects of immersion, according to the following test: 
 

• Surface of the water level shall be at least 150 mm (5.9 in) above the highest point of the 
 machine  
• Lowest point of the machine must be at least 1 m (39.4 in) below the surface of the water  
• Duration of the test must be at least 30 minutes  
• Water temperature must not differ from that of the machine by more than 5° C

4.2 Absolute Encoder Battery Packs 
All α Series servo motors feature a built-in serial encoder that can be used in either incremental or 
absolute mode. To utilize the absolute capability, an optional encoder battery pack (IC800ABK001) must 
be installed. This pack makes the encoder’s position information non-volatile so that the machine does 
not need to be re-referenced to a home position every time power is restored to the servo system. 

The Absolute Encoder Battery Kit (IC800ABK001) contains the following: 

 One battery holder (ZA06B-6050-K060) 

 Four D-cell, alkaline batteries (ZA98L-0031-0005) 

One kit provides battery backup for up to four absolute encoders. A two-meter-long cable   
(Z44C741863-001) must be ordered separately for each servo axis connected to the battery pack. Kit 
components cannot be ordered separately. 

The battery pack is panel-mounted and requires a cutout in the mounting surface. Mounting dimensions 
and terminal designations are shown below:

The servo motor must be installed in a location that satisfies the following environmental conditions: 
Table  I-7. Servo amplifier environmental conditions 

Condition Description 

Ambient temperature The ambient temperature should be -10°C to 40°C. When operating the machine at a 
temperature higher than 40°C (55°C max), it is necessary to derate the output power 
so that the motor’s temperature rating is not exceeded. 

Vibration When installed in a machine, the vibration applied to the motor must not exceed 5G. 

Altitude No more than 1,000 m (3,300 ft) above sea level. 

Drip-Proof Environment The motors have a drip-proof structure that complies with IP65 of the IEC standard. 
Optional IP67 Sealing, available on most α Series servo motors, offers further 
protection from liquids (see Section 4.1 for more details). Nevertheless, to ensure 
long-term performance, the motor surface should be protected from solvents, 
lubricants, and fluid spray. A cover should be used when there is a possibility of 
wetting the motor surface. Also, to prevent fluid from being led to the motor through 
the cable, put a drip loop in the cable when the motor is mounted. Finally, turn the 
motor connector sideways or downward as far as possible. If the cable connector will 
be subjected to moisture, it is recommended that an R class or waterproof plug be 
used. 

For additional information, see GE Fanuc publication Servo and Spindle Motors Exposed to Liquids, 
GFK-1046. 

5.2 Servo Amplifier Environmental Requirements 
The servo amplifier must be installed in a location that satisfies the environmental conditions identified in 
Table 8 below. 
Table  I-8. Servo amplifier environmental conditions 

Condition Description 

Ambient temperature 0°C to 55°C (operating). 
-20°C to 60°C (storage and transportation). 

Temperature fluctuation Within 1.1°C/min. 
Humidity 30% to 95% RH (no condensation). 
Altitude No more than 1000 m (3,300 ft) above sea level. 
Vibration No more than 0.5 G during operation. 
Atmosphere The circuitry and heat sink must not be exposed to any 

corrosive and conductive vapor or liquid. 
The amplifier must be installed in a cabinet that protects it from contaminants such as dust, coolant, 
organic solvents, acid, corrosive gas, and salt. Adequate protection must also be provided for 
applications where the amplifier could be exposed to radiation, such as microwave, ultraviolet, laser light, 
or x-rays. 



Servo Products Specification Guide 

I-12  Servo Products Specification Guide –  October 2007 GFH-001F 
 

To adequately protect the amplifier, you must ensure that: 

 Contaminants such as dust and coolant, cannot enter through the air inlet or outlet. 
 The flow of cooling air is not obstructed. 
 The amplifier can be accessed for inspection. 
 The amplifier can be disassembled for maintenance and later reinstalled. 
 There is sufficient separation between the power and signal lines to avoid interference. Noise 

protection should be provided. 

5.3 α SVU Series servo amplifier heat Dissipation 
To determine the heat generated by an α Series SVU amplifier with a particular motor, use the table that 
follows. The α SVU Series amplifiers are mounted with their heat sink extending through a panel cut out 
in the control enclosure. This design eliminates most of the heat dissipation inside the control cabinet. 

Table  I-9. Servo amplifier heat dissipation 

Motor Model Amplifier Model Total 
Dissipation 

Dissipation Inside 
Cabinet 

α6/3000 α SVU1-80 73 W 38 W 

α12/3000 α SVU1-80 106 W 47 W 

α22/2000 α SVU1-80 127 W 54 W 

α30/3000 α SVU1-130 228 W 71 W 

α40/2000 w/ Fan α SVU1-130 276 W 81 W 
 

The following notes apply to the heat values: 

 The heat dissipation values are worst case values when motors are run at their continuous output 
ratings. 

 If the heat sink of the amplifier is installed outside the cabinet or if a separate regenerative resistor is 
installed outside the cabinet, it is unnecessary to add the heat generated by the regenerative resistor 
to the total heat generated by the cabinet. If the heat sink of a built-in or separate regenerative 
resistor is installed inside the cabinet, it is necessary to add the heat generated by the regenerative 
resistor to the heat generated by the cabinet. See Section 6.6 for more information.

5.5 Shaft Loading  
The allowable load of the motor shaft is as follows: 

Table  I-10. Allowable motor shaft load 

Motor Model Radial Load Axial Load Front Bearing 
Type 

α6/3000 70 kg (31.8 lb) 20 kg (9.1 lb) 6205 

α12/3000, α22/2000, 
α30/3000, α40/2000 w/ fan 

450 kg (204 lb) 135 kg (61.4 lb) 6208 

 

NOTES: 

 The allowable radial load is the value when a load is applied to the shaft end. It indicates the total 
continuous force applied to the shaft in some methods of mounting (for example, belt tension) and the 
force by load torque (for example, moment/pulley radius). 

 The belt tension is critical particularly when a timing belt is used. Belts that are too tight may cause 
breakage of the shaft or premature bearing failure. Belt tension must be controlled so as not to 
exceed the limits calculated from the permissible radial load indicated above. 

 In some operating conditions, the pulley diameter or gear size needs to be checked. For example, 
when using the model α6/3000 with a pulley/gear with a radius of 1.5 cm (2 in) or less, the radial load 
when 230 in-lb of peak torque is provided by the motor will exceed the 154 lb maximum rating. In the 
case of the timing belt, the belt tension is added to this value, making it necessary to support the 
shaft end. 

 When using a timing belt, shaft failure or bearing overload can be minimized by positioning the pulley 
as close to the bearing as possible. 

 Since a standard single row, deep-groove ball bearing is used for the motor bearing, a very large 
axial load cannot be used. Particularly when using a worm gear and a helical gear, it is necessary to 
provide another bearing to isolate the thrust load from the searing. 

 The motor bearing is generally fixed with a C-snap ring, and there is a small play in the axial 
direction. When this play influences the positioning in the case of using a worm gear and a helical 
gear, for example, it is necessary to use an additional bearing support.

5.7 α SVU Series Switch Settings 
There are four channel switches located above the 7-segment LED and behind

5.8 Noise Protection 

Separation of Signal and Power Lines 
When routing signal and power lines, the signal lines must be separated from the power lines to ensure 
best noise immunity. Table 5I-12 below lists the types of cables used: 

Table I-12. Servo amplifier signal line separation  

Group Signal Action 

A Amplifier input power line, 
motor power line, MCC drive 
coil 

Separate these cables from those of group B by bundling them 
separately* or by means of electromagnetic shielding**. Attach a noise 
preventer or suppressor, such as a spark arrester, to the MCC drive coil. 

B Cable connecting control unit 
with servo amplifier and serial 
encoder feedback cable 

Separate these cables from those of group A by bundling them separately 
or by means of electromagnetic shielding**. In addition, shielding must be 
provided. 

* The bundle of group A cables must be separated from the bundle of group B cables by at least 10 cm.  
**  Electromagnetic shielding involves shielding groups from each other by means of a grounded metal (steel) plate. 

Grounding 
A typical machine has three separate grounds: 

 Signal Ground:  Provides the reference potential (0 V) for the electrical signal system. 
 Frame Ground:  Ensures safety and shields external and internal noise. 
 System Ground:  Connects each unit and the inter-unit frame ground system to earth ground.

Servo Products Specification Guide 

 

Part I: α Series Servo System  I-27 

Notes on the ground system wiring for α SVU1 Series amplifiers: 
 The ground resistance of the system ground must not exceed 100 ohms (Class-3 ground). 
 System ground connection cables must have a sufficiently large cross-sectional area to enable them 

to safely carry the current that will arise in the event of a problem such as a short-circuit (in general, a 
cross-sectional area no less than that of the AC power line must be provided). 

 The system ground connection cable must be integrated with the AC power line such that power 
cannot be supplied if the ground wire is disconnected. 

 The motor frame must be referenced to earth ground with a class 3 (100 ohms or less) system 
ground. Use an ohmmeter to measure the resistance from the servomotor frame to a known earth 
ground rod or grid. The frame-to-ground resistance should be within 1 to 2 ohms.  
In a high noise environment, installing a ground wire on the motor frame and routing it directly to the 
nearest available earth ground can improve noise immunity. Some servo motors have a tapped hole 
on the frame or a blind hole that can be tapped. For smaller motors, connect to the motor mounting 
bolts. 

 The Motor Power cable should not be a shielded cable. If a custom built cable with shield was used 
for motor power, lift the shield connection at both ends of the cable. If a shield is attached, especially 
at the motor end, it acts as an antenna to couple noise into the encoder. 

 The Motor Feedback cable should have the Z44B295864-001 Grounding Bar and one ZA99L-0035-
001 Grounding Clamp per axis installed near the amplifier. Confirm that the grounding bar is 
referenced to earth ground with a class 3 (100 ohms or less) system ground. Use an ohmmeter to 
measure the resistance from the grounding bar frame to a known earth ground rod or grid. The frame 
to ground resistance should be within 1 to 2 ohms. 

In a high noise environment, installing a ferrous bead on the feedback cable within a short distance of the 
amplifier connector can also improve noise immunity. 

 Separation of Motor Power and Motor Feedback cables: Group A signals (Amplifier main AC power, 
Motor Power Cable and MCC drive coil) signals must be separated from Group B signals (Motor 
Feedback cable) by at least a 10cm distance. Do not tie Group A and B signals together with cable 
ties or wraps at any point. An alternative is to separate these two groups by means of a grounded 
metal (steel) plate. 

 The MCC relay used to switch the three-phase AC main power to the amplifier should have an 
appropriate noise (spark arrester) on its drive coil. 

 An AC line filter is recommended to suppress high frequency line noise on the amplifier main power 
lines. When an isolation transformer is used to convert AC main power to amplifier input power levels, 
the AC line filter is not required. GE Fanuc supplies an acceptable three-phase line filter sized for 
5.4KW or 10.5KW especially for this purpose. This filtered AC main power should not be shared with 
other equipment in the panel, especially with devices such as inverter drives or motor starters that 
have high power consumption. 

 Amplifier Chassis Ground must be referenced to earth ground with a class 3 (100 ohm or less) 
system ground. User an ohmmeter to measure the resistance from the amplifier frame to a known 
earth ground rod or grid. A tapped and threaded hole is provided on the amplifier frame for this 
purpose. 

 AC Main PE Ground is supplied in accordance to local code practices and may vary, depending on 
AC power distribution in the facility. In general the PE ground should be referenced to an earth 
ground and not indicate common mode voltage to the instrumentation earth ground.

5.9 Command Cable Grounding 
The GE Fanuc controller cables that require shielding should be clamped by the method shown below. 
This cable clamp treatment provides both cable support (strain relief) and proper grounding of the shield. 
To ensure stable system operation, the cable clamp method is recommended. Partially peel back the 
cable sheath to expose the shield. Push the clamp (ZA99L-0035-0001) over the exposed shield and 
insert the clamp hooks into slots on the grounding bar (Z44B295864-001). Tighten the clamp to secure 
cable and complete the ground connection. The grounding bar must be attached to a low impedance 
earth ground.

5.10 Selecting a Ground Fault Interrupter 
The α Series servo amplifier drives a motor by means of the transistor-based PWM inverter method, in 
which a high-frequency leakage current flows to ground through the stray capacitance of the motor 
windings, power cable, and amplifier. A ground fault interrupter or leakage-protection relay, which is 
installed on the power supply side, can malfunction if such a leakage current should flow. Therefore, you 
should select an inverter-compatible ground fault interrupter capable of handling the approximate leakage 
currents shown below to protect against the occurrence of this malfunction: 

 α6/3000:  choose a 1.8 mA commercial frequency component. 
 α12/3000, α22/2000:  choose a 2.0 mA commercial frequency component. 
 α30/3000, α40/2000:  choose a 2.5 mA commercial frequency component. 

 

 



Servo Products Specification Guide 

I-30  Servo Products Specification Guide –  October 2007 GFH-001F 
 

Section 6: α Servo System Power Requirements 
This section provides information about AC amplifier power as well as the discharge of regenerative 
power. 

6.1  Power Line Protection 
A circuit breaker, electromagnetic contactor and AC line filter or transformer should be installed as part of 
your α Series Servo system. GE Fanuc provides the AC line filter as an option. The transformer, circuit 
breaker, and electromagnetic contactor, however, are user-supplied components. In European countries 
where power sources are 380 to 400 VAC and neutral grounded, it is necessary to install a transformer. 

The same incoming AC control components can be used to provide power to multiple amplifiers, as long 
as the components are rated for the current and power drawn by the sum of all of the amplifiers. 

6.2 AC Line Filter    
An AC line filter is recommended to suppress the influences of high-frequency input line noise on the 
drive power supply. When an isolation-type power transformer is used because a power supply voltage 
within the specified range is not available, an AC line filter is not required. 

If two or more servo amplifiers are connected to one AC line filter, the total continuous output rating of all 
connected servo amplifiers should be kept below the continuous output rating of the AC line filter. The 
continuous output rating for the various servos are shown below. 
 
Table I-13. α servo motor continuous output rating 
 

Motor Cont. Output Rating 

α6/3000 1.4 kW 

α12/3000 2.8 kW 

α22/2000 3.8 kW 

α30/3000 4.8 kW 

α40/2000 with fan 7.3 kW 

 

If your installation must be EMC compliant, verify that the use of an AC line filter fully satisfies the EMC 
requirements. You may need to select and install a user-supplied noise filter to meet EMC requirements.  

GE Fanuc offers the AC line filters that can be used with the Alpha Series amplifiers: 

 5.4 kW, 3-phase (ZA81L-0001-0083#3C)

6.3 Circuit Breaker Selection 
To provide proper protection for the amplifier, use a circuit breaker rated at no more than 20 Amps (10A 
for VDE 1601 compliance for CE marking). Table 6I-15 will help you select the appropriate circuit breaker 
for your motion application. 

Table I-15. Currents drawn at continuous rated output 

Motor Input Current   
3-phase* 

α6/3000 6 A (rms) 

α12/3000 11 A (rms) 

α22/2000 15 A (rms) 

α30/3000 21 A (rms) 

α40/2000 29 A (rms) 

*This factor attempts to compensate for applications where all axes are not demanding full power at the same time. For applications 
where all axes are running continuously or with high duty cycles, this factor must be increased to 1. 

 

6.4 Electromagnetic Contactor (MCC) Rating 
To prepare for incoming AC power, you must also select and install an appropriate electromagnetic 
contactor (MCC), based on the peak currents for the motors in your system. A contactor is typically 
required on systems approved to display the CE marking (Machinery Directive). When multiple amplifiers 
are connected to a single circuit breaker, select a breaker based on the sum of the currents in Table 6I-15. 

 

NOTE 
When multiple amplifiers are connected to a single circuit 
breaker, select a breaker by multiplying the sum of the 
currents listed in Table 65HI-15 by 0.6.* 

During rapid motor acceleration, a current that is three 
times the continuous rating flows. Select a circuit breaker 
that does not trip when a current that is three times the 
continuous rating flows for two seconds.

Part I: α Series Servo System  I-33 

6.5  Incoming AC Power 
The α SVU Series servo amplifiers require a three-phase AC input for main bus power and a single-
phase AC input for control power. Two terminals of the three-phase input (L1 and L2) are connected with 
the terminals for the single-phase input by jumper bars on terminal board T1 at the factory. If you want to 
separate the two power supplies, remove the jumper bars. The power requirements for these supplies 
are shown below:  

Table I-16. AC and control power

Table I-17. Control power current 

Amplifier Model Control Power Current

AC Power Ratings 
The power supply rating required when using multiple servo motors can be determined by summing the 
requirements of the individual motors. 

The power supply ratings listed in Table 7I-18 are sufficient as continuous ratings. Note, however, that 
servo motor acceleration causes a current to momentarily flow that is approximately three times the 
continuous flow rating. 

When the power is turned on, a surge current of about 37A (when 264VAC is applied) flows for 20 msec.

6.6  Discharging Regenerative Energy 
Regenerative energy is normally created in applications with a high load inertia or frequent acceleration 
and deceleration. When decelerating a load, the stored kinetic energy of the load causes generator action 
in the motor causing energy to be returned to the α Series amplifier. 

The α SVU amplifiers have a regenerative discharge resistor built in to dissipate this energy. For light 
loads, low acceleration rates, or low speed machines, the amplifier may be able to handle the 
regenerated energy. Some applications may require the assistance of a separately mounted external 
regenerative discharge unit. Vertical axes with no counter balance may generate excessive regenerative 
energy. These units comply with VDE 0160, European Safety Standards for CE marking. 

Three separate regenerative discharge units are available for the α SVU Series amplifiers: 

 16 Ω, 200 W (ZA06B-6089-H500) for the SVU1-80 (weight of 2.2 Kg [4.8 lb]) 

 16 Ω, 800 W (ZA06B-6089-H713) for the SVU1-80 (weight of 5 Kg [11 lb]) 

 8 Ω, 800 W (ZA06B-6089-H711) for the SVU1-130 (weight of 5 Kg [11 lb]) 

Calculations to determine if a separate regenerative discharge unit is required are shown in “Calculating 
the Average Regenerative Energy.” 

If the regenerative discharge unit overheats, a built-in thermostat is tripped, the external overheat alarm is 
issued, and the motor is stopped. If an external regenerative discharge unit is required, a separate unit 
must be installed for each amplifier. This component cannot be daisy-chained. The dimensions for these 
units are shown in on page I-38. Connections for cables K7 and K8 are shown on p. I-52 of this 
document. 

 

Calculating the Average Regenerative Energy 
Use the following calculation to determine the average regenerative power that will be released in your 
application (ambient temperature is assumed not to exceed 55°C). Based on the calculations, a separate 
regenerative discharge unit may be required. If this is the case, select either the 200 W or 800 W 
regenerative discharge unit as appropriate for the amplifier model. The watt rating of the selected unit 
must exceed the average calculated regenerative power.

STEP 4—Determine if a separate regenerative discharge unit is required 

When the average regenerative power produced never exceeds the values indicated in Table 75HI-19, a 
separate regenerative discharge unit is NOT required: 

 Average Regenerative Power = P1 – P2 + P3

If the average regenerative power exceeds the value for the amplifier, only then is a separate 
regenerative discharge unit required. Select a unit from Table 77HI-20 that exceeds the calculated power 
value.

EXAMPLE: 

Assume a vertical axis using an α12/3000 motor (Jm = 0.0555 lb-in-s2) that decelerates once every 4 
seconds (F = 4) for 0.10 seconds (ta) from a maximum speed of 2500 rpm (ωm). The machine load inertia 
reflected to the motor shaft (JL) is 0.05 lb-in-s2. The torque (max) required to support the load during a 
downward move (Th) is 100 in-lb, and the downward motion is 20% of the cycle (D). Axis friction (TL) is 35 
in-lb. 

STEP 1: 
P1 = Rotational Power  = (6.19 x 10-4) x (0.0555 + 0.05) x 20002/4  

 = 65.3 Watts 

STEP 2: 
P2 = Friction Power = (5.91 x 10-3) x 0.10 x 2000 x 35/4 

 = 10.3 Watts 

STEP 3: 

P3 = Vertical Power = (1.182 x 10-2) x 100 x 2000 x 
100
20

   = 472.8 Watts 

STEP 4: 
Average Power = P1 – P2 + P3 

 = 65.3 – 10.3 + 472.8 

 = 527.8 Watts  

 (Note the large value associated with the non-counterbalanced vertical load) 

Since this value is larger than the 100 W internal capacity of the αSVU1-80 amplifier used with this motor, 
a separate regenerative discharge unit is required. The ZA06B-6089-H713 unit is adequate since its 
800 W rating exceeds the 539.1 W average for the application. With a customer-supplied fan with at least 
a 4 m/sec flow rate, the ZA06B-6089-H500 unit could also be used.

Location and designation of each connector is shown in Figure  86HI-25. 

Figure  I-25.  Bottom view of αSVU amplifier 
 

7.2 α System Connections 
When planning your system, it is important to determine how the different parts of the system connect 
together. Cable reference numbers K1 through K15 on the α Servo Connection Diagram in Section 7.3 
and in Table 90HI-22 indicate the required and optional system connections.  

The α Series motor and amplifier connectors required for the system are available from GE Fanuc.  

GE Fanuc supplies connectors to allow you to manufacture cables to the specific length required by your 
system design. GE Fanuc does offer finished cables as options for many connections. See the Cable 
Connections chart that follows for more information. 

An external contactor (MCC) connector (ZA06B-6089-K201) and E-Stop connector (ZA02B-0120-K321) 
are shipped with each α Series servo amplifier package. 

Optional As are also available for the various  and feedback cables.

7.3 α SERIES Servo Connection Diagram 

NOTES 

 An AC line filter is recommended (unless an isolation transformer is provided) to reduce the effect of harmonic 
noises to the power supply. Two or more αSVU amplifiers can be connected to one AC line filter if its power 
capacity is not exceeded. 

 RC and RI were connected to each other through a jumper bar at the factory. If a separate regenerative 
discharge unit will be used,  the jumper bar must be removed. 

 TH1 and TH2 were connected to each other through a jumper bar at the factory. Remove the jumper bar and 
connect these terminals to the separate regenerative discharge unit and resistor thermal switch. 

 Only the αSVU1-130 (ZA06B-6089-H106) has FAN1 and FAN2 terminals. Connect the terminals to the fan motor 
(K11 cable) of the separate regenerative discharge unit (other than the ZA06B-6089-H106). If a fan is to be used 
with the aSVU1-80 the fan power should be connected to L1C and L2C through a 5-amp circuit breaker as 
shown. 

 For CE Mark applications, an MCC that complies with European standards should be selected. The user should 
determine details of the use of the MCC.

NOTES 

The servo command cables for the DSM300 Series controller 
(IC800CBL001 and IC800CBL002) must be purchased from GE Fanuc. 
Proper tooling is required to assemble the connectors. For custom length 
cables, contact your GE Fanuc Distributor or GE Fanuc Sales Engineer.  

Grounding the cable shield using the grounding bar (Z44B295864-001) 
and cable grounding clamp (ZA99L-0035-0001) will provide greater 
noise immunity. 

 

 Wire:  0.08mm2 twisted pair group shielded cable (10 pairs). The following wire is recommended for 
the K1 cable: 28 AWG x 10 pairs (20 conductors).

Section 8: α SVU Series Protection and Alarm Functions 
The Servo Amplifier Unit can detect error conditions and provide alarm information. 

The LEDs on the front of the amplifier provide a visual cue to the status of the system by indicating, for 
example, when the motor and amplifier are ready to function. A built-in, seven-segment LED display 
indicates when an alarm condition is detected. When an alarm is detected, power is dropped and the 
motor is stopped by dynamic braking action. Alarm information is displayed as diagnostic data in the GE 
Fanuc controller. Table95HI-23 details the alarm conditions the α SVU Series Servo Amplifier System 
can detect. Table 96HI-24 shows the LED indication for normal operating mode. 

Table I-23. α SVU1 Series servo amplifier alarm system 

Alarm Type LED Ind. Description 

Over-voltage alarm (HV)  1 Occurs if the DC voltage of the main circuit power supply is 
abnormally high. 

Low control power voltage alarm (LV)  2 Occurs if the control power voltage is abnormally low. 

Low DC link voltage alarm (LVDC) 3 Occurs if the DC voltage of the main circuit power supply is 
abnormally low or if the circuit breaker trips. 

Regenerative discharge control circuit 
failure alarm (DCSW) 

4 Occurs if the short-time peak regenerative discharge energy is 
too high or if the regenerative discharge circuit is abnormal. 

Over-regenerative discharge alarm 
(DCOH) 

5 Occurs if the average regenerative discharge energy is too high 
(too frequent acceleration/deceleration) or the regeneration 
resistor overheats. 

Dynamic brake circuit failure (DBRLY) 7 Occurs if the relay contacts of the dynamic brake fuse together. 

Over-current alarm  8 Occurs if an abnormally high current flows through the motor. 

IPM alarm  8. The Intelligent Power Module (IPM) has detected an alarm due 
to over-current, overheating, or a drop in IPM control power 
voltage. 

Circuit breaker (trips) The circuit breaker trips if an abnormally high current 
(exceeding the working current of the circuit breaker) flows 
through it.

Section 9: β Servo System Block Diagram 
The following block diagram shows the interconnections of a typical β Series servo system: 

 

Figure 2HII-1.  β Series servo block diagram 

NOTE 

A 24 VDC power supply, circuit breaker, electromagnetic contactor, surge 
suppresser, and transformer or line filter should be user-installed as part of 
the system. See β Servo System Package Options in 3HSection 12: and β 
Servo Installation in 4HSection 13:of this document for more information. 

 

• For single phase input, the lifetime of the amplifier is reduced because of higher input current. For 
operation of β6/2000 or αC12/2000 motors at acceleration/deceleration duty cycles greater than 1 
cycle/20 seconds, 3-phase input is recommended. The output power of these motors when operated 
in ambient temperatures greater than 40°C must be derated linearly at 1%/°C above 40°C up to a 
maximum ambient temperature of 55°C.

10.2 β Series Motor Speed–Torque Curves   
The curves shown below illustrate the relationship between the speed of the motor and the output torque. The 
motor can operate continuously at any combination of speed and torque within the prescribed continuous 
operating zone. The limit of the continuous operating zone is determined with the motor’s ambient 
temperature at 40°C and its drive current as pure sine wave. The current of the servo drive unit limits actual 
operation.

10.3 β Series Motor Holding Brake 
Any of the servo motors can be ordered with a holding brake. The brake is used to prevent movement on 
horizontal axes or falling along the vertical axis when the servo motor control is turned off. 

Brakes are spring-set and electrically released and are designed for holding stationary loads only. Using the 
holding brake to stop a moving axis may damage the motor or severely reduce its service life. 

The specifications of the built-in brakes are listed in Table 9HII-2.

Part II: β Series Servo System  II-11 
 

12.1 Absolute Encoder Battery Packs 
All β Series servo motors feature a built-in encoder that can be used in either incremental or absolute mode. 
To utilize the absolute capability, an optional encoder battery pack (IC800BBK021) for the β Series amplifier 
must be installed. This pack allows the encoder’s position information to be backed up so that the machine 
does not need to be re-referenced to a home position every time power is restored to the servo system. 

For optimal panel space utilization, a small lithium battery pack is available that snaps onto the underside of 
the β amplifier. An integral pigtail cable plugs directly into the CX5 connector. One battery is required for each 
amplifier. 

Absolute Encoder Battery Kit (IC800BBK021) contains the following: 

 Battery (ZA06B-6093-K001) 

 Battery Holder (ZA06B-6093-K002) 

Note: Current drain (per encoder) from battery: 

 20μA with amplifier power ON

NOTE 
Do not attempt to connect multiple amplifiers to 
one IC800BBK021 battery kit. If you wish to 
daisy chain multiple β Series amplifiers to one 
battery you must use the IC800ABK001 battery 
kit and the following cables: 
• Z44C742433-001, battery to amplifier cable, 

2m (one per battery required) 
• Z44C742433-002, amplifier to amplifier 

cable, 250mm (one for each daisy chained 
amplifier required) 



Servo Products Specification Guide 
 

II-12  Servo Products Specification Guide –  October 2007 GFH-001F 
 
 

Section 13: Installation Guidelines 
This section includes environmental requirements, motor and amplifier dimension drawings and information 
on ensuring noise protection and selecting a ground fault interrupter. 

13.1 Motor Environmental Requirements 
The servo motor must be installed in a location that satisfies the following environmental conditions: 
Table II-8. Servo amplifier environmental conditions 

Condition Description 

Ambient temperature The ambient temperature should be -10°C to 40°C. When operating the machine at a 
temperature higher than 40°C), it is necessary to derate the output power so that the 
motor’s temperature rating is not exceeded. 

Vibration When installed in a machine, the vibration applied to the motor must not exceed 5G. 

Altitude No more than 1,000 m (3,300 ft) above sea level. 

Drip-Proof Environment The motors have a drip-proof structure that complies with IP65 of the IEC 
standard. Nevertheless, to ensure long-term performance, the motor surface 
should be protected from solvents, lubricants, and fluid spray. A cover should 
be used when there is a possibility of wetting the motor surface. Also, to 
prevent fluid from being led to the motor through the cable, put a drip loop in 
the cable when the motor is mounted. Finally, turn the motor connector 
sideways or downward as far as possible. If the cable connector will be 
subjected to moisture, it is recommended that an R class or waterproof plug 
be used. 

For additional information, see GE Fanuc publication Servo and Spindle Motors Exposed to Liquids, 
GFK-1046. 

13.2 Servo Amplifier Environmental Requirements 
The servo amplifier must be installed in a location that satisfies the environmental conditions identified in 
Table 23HII-9 below. 

Table II-9. Servo Amplifier Environmental Conditions 

Condition Description 

Ambient temperature 0°C to 55°C (operating). 
-20°C to 60°C (storage and transportation). 

Temperature 
fluctuation 

Within 1.1°C/min. 

Humidity 30% to 95% RH (no condensation). 
Altitude No more than 1000 m (3,300 ft) above sea level. 
Vibration No more than 0.5 G during operation. 
Atmosphere The circuitry and cooling fins must not be exposed to any corrosive and conductive vapor or 

liquid. 

The amplifier must be installed in a cabinet that protects it from contaminants such as dust, coolant, organic 
solvents, acid, corrosive gas, and salt. Adequate protection must also be provided for applications where the 
amplifier could be exposed to radiation, such as microwave, ultraviolet, laser light, or x-rays. 



Servo Products Specification Guide 
 

 

Part II: β Series Servo System  II-13 
 

To adequately protect the amplifier, you must ensure that: 

 Contaminants such as dust and coolant, cannot enter through the air inlet or outlet. 
 The flow of cooling air is not obstructed. 
 The amplifier can be accessed for inspection. 
 The amplifier can be disassembled for maintenance and later reinstalled. 
 There is sufficient separation between the power and signal lines to avoid interference. Noise 

protection should be provided. 

13.3 β Servo Amplifier heat dissipation and maintenance  
The amplifier contains a cooling fan that forces air through the unit. Allow for adequate clearance for airflow 
when installing the amplifier using the recommended distances shown in the drawings below. If possible, do 
not mount amplifiers one above the other unless they are staggered to prevent the heated exhaust of the 
lower unit from flowing over the upper unit.

αC12/2000 450 kg (990 lb) 135 kg (297 lb) 6208 

 

NOTES: 

 The allowable radial load is the value when a load is applied to the shaft end. It indicates the total 
continuous force applied to the shaft in some methods of mounting (for example, belt tension) and the 
force by load torque (for example, moment/pulley radius). 

 The belt tension is critical particularly when a timing belt is used. Belts that are too tight may cause 
breakage of the shaft or premature bearing failure. Belt tension must be controlled so as not to exceed 
the limits calculated from the permissible radial load indicated above. 

 In some operating conditions, the pulley diameter or gear size needs to be checked. For example, when 
using the model β6/2000 with a pulley/gear with a radius of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) or less, the radial load 
when 230 in-lb of peak torque is provided by the motor will exceed the 154 lb maximum rating. In the 
case of the timing belt, the belt tension is added to this value, making it necessary to support the shaft 
end. 

 When using a timing belt, shaft failure or bearing overload can be minimized by positioning the pulley as 
close to the bearing as possible. 

 Since a standard single row, deep-groove ball bearing is used for the motor bearing, a very large axial 
load cannot be used. Particularly when using a worm gear and a helical gear, it is necessary to provide 
another bearing to isolate the thrust load from the gearing. 

 The motor bearing is generally fixed with a C-snap ring, and there is a small play in the axial direction. 
When this play influences the positioning in the case of using a worm gear and a helical gear, for 
example, it is necessary to use an additional bearing support.

13.7 Noise Protection 
Separation of Signal and Power Lines 
When routing signal and power lines, the signal lines must be separated from the power lines to ensure best 
noise immunity. The  table below lists the types of cables used: 

Table II-12. Servo amplifier signal line separation  

Group Signal Action 

A Amplifier input power line, 
motor power line, MCC drive 
coil 

Separate these cables from those of group B by bundling them 
separately* or by means of electromagnetic shielding**. Attach a noise 
preventer or suppressor, such as a spark arrester, to the MCC drive coil. 

B Cable connecting control unit 
with servo amplifier and serial 
encoder feedback cable 

Separate these cables from those of group A by bundling them separately 
or by means of electromagnetic shielding**. In addition, shielding must be 
provided. 

* The bundle of group A cables must be separated from the bundle of group B cables by at least 10 cm.  
**  Electromagnetic shielding involves shielding groups from each other by means of a grounded metal (steel) plate. 

Grounding 
A typical machine has three separate grounds: 

 Signal Ground:  Provides the reference potential (0 V) for the electrical signal system. 
 Frame Ground:  Ensures safety and shields external and internal noise. 
 System Ground:  Connects each unit and the inter-unit frame ground system to earth ground.

II-22  Servo Products Specification Guide –  October 2007 GFH-001F 
 
 

Notes on the ground system wiring: 
 The ground resistance of the system ground must not exceed 100 ohms (Class-3 ground). 

 System ground connection cables must have a sufficiently large cross-sectional area to enable them to 
safely carry the current that will arise in the event of a problem such as a short-circuit (in general, a 
cross-sectional area no less than that of the AC power line must be provided). 

 The system ground connection cable must be integrated with the AC power line such that power cannot 
be supplied if the ground wire is disconnected. 

 The CX11-3 grounding connector is supplied to provide the servo motor frame ground connection and 
should always be installed. A separate 1 meter long cable for this connection is included with the 
optional GE Fanuc prefinished motor power cables. 

 The motor frame must be referenced to earth ground with a class 3 (100 ohms or less) system ground. 
Use an ohmmeter to measure the resistance from the servomotor frame to a known earth ground rod or 
grid. When using the 20 amp amplifier (SVM-20i), the servo motor frame ground connection on 
connector CZ7-3 pin A2 should always be installed. The frame-to-ground resistance should be within 1 
to 2 ohms.  

 In a high noise environment, installing a ground wire on the motor frame and routing it directly to the 
nearest available earth ground can improve noise immunity. Some servo motors have a tapped hole on 
the frame or a blind hole that can be tapped. For smaller motors, connect to the motor mounting bolts. 

 The Motor Power cable should not be a shielded cable. If a custom built cable with shield was used for 
motor power, lift the shield connection at both ends of the cable. If a shield is attached, especially at the 
motor end, it acts as an antenna to couple noise into the encoder. 

 The Motor Feedback cable should have the Z44B295864-001 Grounding Bar and one ZA99L-0035-001 
Grounding Clamp per axis installed near the amplifier. Confirm that the grounding bar is referenced to 
earth ground with a class 3 (100 ohms or less) system ground. Use an ohmmeter to measure the 
resistance from the grounding bar frame to a known earth ground rod or grid. The frame to ground 
resistance should be within 1 to 2 ohms. 

In a high noise environment, installing a ferrous bead on the feedback cable within a short distance of 
the amplifier connector can also improve noise immunity. 

 Separation of Motor Power and Motor Feedback cables: Group A signals (Amplifier main AC power, 
Motor Power Cable and MCC drive coil) signals must be separated from Group B signals (Motor 
Feedback cable) by at least a 10cm distance. Do not tie Group A and B signals together with cable ties 
or wraps at any point. An alternative is to separate these two groups by means of a grounded metal 
(steel) plate. 

 The MCC relay used to switch the three-phase AC main power to the amplifier should have an 
appropriate noise (spark) arrester on its drive coil. 

 The 24VDC power supply used to supply the logic power to the amplifiers should be a regulated supply 
free of excessive noise. If possible examine the DC voltage with an oscilloscope for noise. If a 24 VDC 
motor-mounted holding brake is used, it should not use the same power supply as the control logic 
power. 



Servo Products Specification Guide 
 

 

Part II: β Series Servo System  II-23 
 

 An AC line filter is recommended to suppress high frequency line noise on the amplifier main power 
lines. When an isolation transformer is used to convert AC main power to amplifier input power levels, 
the AC line filter is not required. GE Fanuc supplies an acceptable three-phase line filter sized for 
5.4KW or 10.5KW especially for this purpose. This filtered AC main power should not be shared with 
other equipment in the panel, especially with devices such as inverter drives or motor starters that have 
high power consumption. 

 Amplifier Chassis Ground must be referenced to earth ground with a class 3 (100 ohm or less) system 
ground. User an ohmmeter to measure the resistance from the amplifier frame to a known earth ground 
rod or grid. A tapped and threaded hole is provided on the amplifier frame for this purpose. 

 AC Main PE Ground is supplied in accordance to local code practices and may vary, depending on AC 
power distribution in the facility. In general the PE ground should be referenced to an earth ground and 
not indicate common mode voltage to the instrumentation earth ground.

13.8 Command Cable Grounding 
The GE Fanuc controller cables that require shielding should be clamped by the method shown below. This 
cable clamp treatment provides both cable support (strain relief) and proper grounding of the shield. To 
ensure table system operation, the cable clamp method is recommended. Partially peel back the cable 
sheath to expose the shield. Push the clamp (ZA99L-0035-0001) over the exposed shield and insert the 
clamp hooks into slots on the grounding bar (Z44B295864-001). Tighten the clamp to secure cable and 
complete the ground connection. The grounding bar must be attached to a low impedance earth ground.

13.9 Selecting a Ground Fault Interrupter 
The β Series servo amplifier drives a motor by means of the transistor-based PWM inverter method, in which 
a high-frequency leakage current flows to ground through the stray capacitance of the motor windings, power 
cable, and amplifier. A ground fault interrupter or leakage-protection relay, which is typically installed on the 
power supply side, can malfunction if such a leakage current should flow. Therefore, you should select an 
inverter-compatible ground fault interrupter with the following ratings to protect against the occurrence of this 
malfunction: 

 β0.5/3000, β2/3000, β3/3000, β6/2000, βM0.5/4000, βM1/4000: choose a 1.8 mA commercial frequency 
component. 

 αC12/2000: choose a 2.0 mA commercial frequency component. 
 



Servo Products Specification Guide 
 

II-26  Servo Products Specification Guide –  October 2007 GFH-001F 
 
 

Section 14: β Servo System Power Requirements 
This section provides information about AC and DC amplifier power as well as the discharge of regenerative 
power. 

14.1 Power Line Protection  
A circuit breaker, electromagnetic contactor, and AC line filter or transformer should be installed as part of 
your β Series Servo system. GE Fanuc provides the AC line filter as an option. The transformer, circuit 
breaker, and electromagnetic contactor, however, are user-supplied components. In European countries 
where power sources are 380 to 400 VAC and neutral grounded, it is necessary to install a transformer or 
supply single-phase power. 

The same incoming AC control components can be used to provide power to multiple amplifiers, as long as 
the components are rated for the current and power drawn by the sum of all of the amplifiers. 

14.2 AC Line Filter  
An AC line filter is recommended to suppress the influences of high-frequency input line noise on the drive 
power supply. When an isolation-type power transformer is used because a power supply voltage within the 
specified range is not available, an AC line filter is not required. 

If two or more servo amplifiers are connected to one AC line filter, the total continuous output rating of all 
connected servo amplifiers should be kept below the continuous output rating of the AC line filter. The 
continuous output rating for the various servos are shown below. 

Table II-13. β Servo Motor Continuous Output Rating 

Motor Cont. Output Rating 

β0.5/3000 0.2 kW 

β2/3000 0.5 kW 

β3/3000 0.5 kW 

β6/2000 0.9 kW 

βM0.5/4000 0.2 kW 

βM1/4000 0.4 kW 

αC12/2000 1.0 kW 

If your installation must be EMC compliant, verify that the use of an AC line filter fully satisfies the EMC 
requirements. You may need to select and install a user-supplied noise filter to meet EMC requirements.  

Two AC line filters are available: 

 5.4 kW, 3-phase (ZA81L-0001-0083#3C) 

 10.5 kW, 3-phase (ZA81L-0001-0101#C) 

For AC line filter specifications and dimension drawings, refer to 0HSection 6.2. 

 



Servo Products Specification Guide 
 

 

Part II: β Series Servo System  II-27 
 

14.3 Circuit Breaker Selection 
To provide proper protection for the amplifier, use a circuit breaker rated at no more than 20 Amps (10A for 
VDE 1601 compliance for CE marking). Table 41HII-14 will help you select the appropriate circuit breaker for your 
motion application. 

Table II-14. Currents Drawn at Continuous Rated Output 

Motor Input Current   
3-phase 

Input Current 
single phase 

β0.5/3000 1.9 A (rms) 3.2 A (rms) 

β2/3000 3.2 A (rms) 5.1 A (rms) 

β3/3000 3.2 A (rms) 5.1 A (rms) 

β6/2000 6.3 A (rms) 10.1 A (rms) 

βM0.5/4000 0.9A (rms) 1.6A (rms) 

βM1/4000 1.8A (rms) 3.2A (rms) 

αC12/2000 6.3 A (rms) 10.1 A (rms) 

 

NOTE 
When multiple amplifiers are connected to a single circuit 
breaker, select a breaker by multiplying the sum of the 
currents listed in Table 42HII-14 by 0.6.* 

Example: Connecting two β6/2000 motors operating on 3-
phase power: 

(6.3 + 6.3) x 0.6 = 7.6 Arms 

A standard 10 Amp circuit breaker can be used. 

During rapid motor acceleration, a peak current that is 
three times the continuous rating flows. Select a circuit 
breaker that does not trip when a current that is three 
times the continuous rating flows for two seconds. 

*This factor attempts to compensate for applications where all axes are not demanding full power at the same time. In 
applications where all axes are running continuously or with high duty cycles, this factor must be increased by 1. 

 

14.4 Electromagnetic Contactor Rating 
To prepare for incoming AC power, you must also select and install an appropriate electromagnetic contactor, 
based on the peak currents for the motors in your system. When multiple amplifiers are connected to a single 
circuit breaker, select a breaker based on the sum of the currents in Table 43HII-14.

* Single-phase operation reduces the lifetime of the servo amplifier. For β6/2000 and αC12/2000 motors with acceleration/deceleration 
duty cycles greater than once every 20 seconds, 3-phase power is recommended. 

 

AC Power Ratings 
The power supply rating required when using multiple servo motors can be determined by summing the 
requirements of the individual motors. 

The power supply ratings listed in Table 44HII-16 are sufficient as continuous ratings. Note, however, that servo 
motor acceleration causes a current to momentarily flow that is approximately three times the continuous 
current rating. 

When the power is turned on, a surge current of about 37A (when 264VAC is applied) flows for 20 msec.

14.6 Incoming DC Power 
The amplifier requires a 24 VDC power supply for amplifier control power. This DC power supply must be 
supplied by the user. 

The information in Table 45HII-17 below will help you select the appropriate DC power supply for your motion 
application. 

The same external DC power supply can be used to provide power to multiple amplifiers as long as the 
supply is rated for the sum of power drawn by all of the amplifiers. To daisy chain the amplifiers, add 
connection K13 between amplifiers (see the connection diagram in Section 46H15.3 for more details). 

Table II-17. DC Amplifier Control Power Specifications 

Specification Description 

Input voltage 24V DC (±10%) 

Power supply rating (per amplifier) 0.4 amps 

 

NOTE 

The 24 VDC input is fused to protect the amplifier. The fuse labeled F600 
is located below the CX11 connector when the amplifier plastic cover is 
removed. The replacement fuse part number is ZA06B-6073-K250 
(Manufacturer:  Daito LM32, DC48V, F3.2A). 

A spare fuse is included with each β amplifier package (IC800BPK012 or 
IC800BPK020) 

 
 

14.7 Discharging Regenerative Energy 
Regenerative energy is normally created in applications with a high load inertia or frequent acceleration and 
deceleration. When decelerating a load, the stored kinetic energy of the load causes generator action in the 
motor causing energy to be returned to the β Series amplifier. For light loads and low acceleration rates, the 
amplifier may be able to absorb this energy. Otherwise, an optional external regenerative discharge unit must 
be installed. 

Two separate 30 Ohm regenerative discharge units are available with ratings of 100 W and 20 W. The 100 W 
unit (ZA06B-6093-H402) is panel-mounted, whereas the 20 W unit (ZA06B-6093-H401) mounts to the tapped 
holes on the side of the amplifier heat sink. Calculations shown later in this section can be used to determine 
the need for an external unit.  

If the regenerative discharge unit overheats, a built-in thermostat is tripped, the external overheat alarm is 
issued, and the motor is stopped. If an external regenerative discharge unit is required, a separate unit must 
be installed for each amplifier. This component cannot be daisy-chained. The dimensions for these units are 
shown in the following drawings. Connections are shown for cables K7 and K8 in Section 47H15.3 of this 
document.

Calculating the Average Regenerative Energy 
Use the following calculation to determine the average regenerative energy that will be released in your 
application (ambient temperature is assumed not to exceed 55°C). Based on the calculations select either the 
20 W or 100 W regeneration resistor. The wattage rating of the selected resistor must exceed the average 
calculated regenerative energy from the equation below:

Part II: β Series Servo System  II-31 
 

STEP 4: Determine if a Regenerative Discharge Unit Is Required 

Determine the Average Regenerative Energy using the equation in the beginning of this section. 

When the average regenerative energy produced never exceeds the amounts that is indicated in Table 48HII-18 
below, a separate regenerative discharge unit is not required: 

Table II-18. Maximum Allowable Regenerative Energy for Amplifiers 

Amplifier Max. Allowable Regen. Energy Used with Motors 

βSVU-12 13 Joules β0.5, β2 
βSVU-20 16 Joules β3, β6, αC12, βM0.5, βM1 

If the calculated value exceeds the storage capability of the amplifier, then an external regenerative discharge 
unit is required (see Step 5). 

 

STEP 5: Selecting a Regenerative Discharge Unit 
If a separate regenerative discharge unit is required, the following calculation will determine whether the 20 W 
or 100 W unit is required:  

 Average Regenerative Power (W) = Average Regenerative Energy (Joules) x 
F
1

 where: 

F = Deceleration duty  (seconds) Example: deceleration once per 5 second cycle, F=5 

Select a regenerative resistor with a rating that exceeds the average regenerative power. If this value is 
greater than 100 W, contact GE Fanuc for assistance. 

 

Example: 

Assume a horizontal axis using a β2 motor (Jm = 0.00581 lb-in-s2) that decelerates once every 6 seconds (F) 
for 0.2 seconds (ta) with a maximum speed of 2000 RPM (ωm). The machine inertia (JL) is 0.0139 lb-in-s2. 
STEP 1:  Rotational Energy = (6.19x10-4)x(0.00581+0.0139)x20002 = 54.4 Joules  
 
STEP 2:  Assuming TL = 10 in-lb: 
            Friction Energy = (5.91x10-3)x0.2x2000x10 = 23.64 Joules 
 
Therefore: 
STEP 4: Average Regenerative Energy = 54.4–23.64 = 30.76 Joules  

Because the 30.76 Joules required is more than the 13 Joules allowed by the βSVU-12 amplifier 
used with the β2 motor, a regenerative resistor is required. 

STEP 5: Since the application requires decelerations every 6 seconds, 
F
1

 = 
6
1

 

 Average Regenerative Power = 30.76 Joules/6 seconds = 5.13 W  
Therefore, the 20 W resistor (ZA06B-6093-H401) is adequate for this application.

NOTES 

The servo command cables for the DSM302 and DSM314 controllers 
(IC800CBL001 and IC800CBL002) must be purchased from GE Fanuc. 
Proper tooling is required to assemble the connectors. For custom length 
cables, contact your GE Fanuc Distributor or GE Fanuc Sales Engineer.  

Grounding the cable shield using the grounding bar (Z44B295864-001) and 
cable grounding clamp (ZA99L-0035-0001) will provide greater noise 
immunity. 

 Wire:  0.08mm2 twisted pair group shielded cable (10 pairs). The following wire is recommended for the 
K1 cable: 28 AWG x 10 pairs (20 conductors).

15.4 β Series Amplifier Protection and Alarm Functions 
The Servo Amplifier Unit can detect error conditions and provide alarm information. 

The LEDs on the front of the amplifier provide a visual cue to the status of the system by indicating, for 
example, when the motor and amplifier are ready to function. The ALM LED is turned ON when an alarm 
condition is detected. When an alarm is detected, power is dropped and the motor is stopped by dynamic 
braking action. Alarm information is displayed as diagnostic data in the GE Fanuc controller. Table 57HII-23 
details the alarm conditions the β Series Servo Amplifier System can detect. 

Table II-23. β Series Servo Amplifier Alarm System 

Alarm Condition Description 

Over-voltage  Issued when the DC voltage in the main circuit power supply is abnormally high. 

DC link under-
voltage  

Issued when the DC voltage in the main circuit power supply is abnormally low or 
when the circuit breaker has tripped. 

Regenerative 
overheat  

Issued when the average regenerative discharge energy is excessively high, such 
as when acceleration/deceleration is performed too frequently. 

Overheat  Issued when the temperature inside the amplifier becomes so high that the 
thermostat trips. 

Fan failure  Issued when the fan unit built into the amplifier fails. 

Over-current Issued when an abnormally high current is detected in the main circuit.

18.2 βis and βHVis Series Motor Speed–Torque Curves 
The curves shown in the following figure illustrate the relationship between the speed of the motor and the 
output torque. The motor can operate continuously at any combination of speed and torque within the 
prescribed continuous operating zone. The limit of the continuous operating zone is determined with the 
motor’s ambient temperature at 20°C and its drive current as pure sine wave. The curves reflect peak torque 
limits based on maximum current of the servo amplifier unit.

18.4 βis and βHVis Series Servo Motor Holding Brake 
The holding brake is used to prevent movement on horizontal axes or falling along the vertical axis when the 
servo motor control is turned off. Brakes are spring-set and electrically released and are designed for holding 
stationary loads only. Using the holding brake to stop a moving axis may damage the brake or severely 
reduce its service life. 

The specifications of the built-in brakes are listed in the following table.

Caution 
To prevent amplifier malfunction or damage do not use the same 24V power supply for 
the amplifier control logic circuitry as the power supply for the brake. 



Servo Products Specification Guide 

 

III-18  Servo Products Specification Guide –  October 2007 GFH-001F 

Option 1: Use a commercial 24 VDC power supply as the power supply for the βis series servo motor brake. 
To prevent amplifier malfunction or damage do not use the same 24V power supply for the amplifier control 
logic circuitry as the power supply for the brake. The power supply for a relay, solenoid, or another peripheral 
device can be used for the brake. Be careful of the power capacity and changes in voltage due to load 
changes. 

Option 2: Alternately you may build a power supply for the brake circuit (equivalent to 24 Vrms) produced by 
full-wave rectification after transforming commercial power (50 Hz/60 Hz). For user built full-wave rectification, 
transform the secondary voltage into approximately 29 VAC by taking voltage drop in the rectifier or cable into 
account. Check to make sure the power capacity and power voltage fluctuations of the voltage applied to the 
brake falls within 24 Vrms ±10%.  

If the brake switching contact is installed on the DC side (at the position shown in the figure), the life of the 
contact is generally shortened due to the surge voltage when the brake is turned off. Provide an adequate 
contact capacity and always use a surge absorber and spark killer for protecting the contact. Installing the 
switching contact on the DC side of the power provides the fastest brake operation time.

19.3 βi & βHVi Series Amplifier Status LED and Alarm Functions 
The Servo Amplifier Unit can detect error conditions and provide alarm information. 

The LEDs on the front of the amplifier provide a visual cue to the status of the system by indicating, for 
example, when the motor and amplifier are ready to function.  

 POWER LED (green) indicates the logic 24 VDC power is present. 

 DC LINK CHARGED LED (red) indicates that the amplifier has high (motor) voltage DC present. 

 LINK LED (green) indicates that the FSSB (fiber optic) interface is functioning.  

 ALM LED (yellow) is turned ON when an alarm condition is detected. When an alarm is detected, 
power is dropped and the motor is stopped by dynamic braking action. Alarm information is 
additionally displayed as diagnostic data in the GE Fanuc DSM324i motion controller. The amplifier 
control power must be cycled to reset this alarm state. The table below details the alarm conditions 
the βi Series Servo Amplifier System can detect.

Table 34HIII-11. βi and βHVi Series Servo Amplifier Alarms 

Alarm Condition Description 

DC Link Under-
Voltage  

Issued when the DC voltage in the main circuit power supply is abnormally low. Indicates low 
AC mains power dip or hardware problem. Make sure the plug-in (gray faceplate) circuit 
board is securely seated in the amplifier base. Replace amplifier. 

DC Link Over-
Voltage 

Issued when the DC voltage in the main circuit power supply is abnormally high. Indicates 
high AC mains power or hardware problem. Make sure the plug-in (gray faceplate) circuit 
board is securely seated in the amplifier base. May also be caused by excessive regenerated 
power. Increase acceleration/deceleration time and/or add additional regenerative discharge 
capacity. Replace amplifier. 

Excessive 
Deceleration Power 

If no external regeneration resistor is used, the discharge resistor thermal sensor jumper is 
missing on connector CXA20. This input requires a normally closed contact for normal 
operation.  

When using an external regeneration resistor, the thermal sensor in the regeneration resistor 
has tripped. Indicating excessive regenerated power load to the regeneration resistor. Use a 
meter to confirm an open circuit on the thermal sensor leads. Make sure the plug-in (gray 
faceplate) circuit board is securely seated in the amplifier base. Increase capacity of external 
regeneration resistor or decrease deceleration rate or frequency, and/or the top speed from 
which the axis must decelerate.  

Control Power 
Under-Voltage 

The 24 VDC control power is below 21.6 VDC. Check the supply voltage level and make sure 
the CXA19A and CXA19B connectors are secure and associated cables are wired correctly. 
Replace amplifier. 

Internal Cooling 
Fan Stopped 

Fan is jammed, has failed or is not connected. Check for foreign material in fan blades. Make 
sure fan is plugged in. Make sure the plug-in (gray faceplate) circuit board is securely seated 
in the amplifier base. Replace amplifier. 

IPM Alarm Excessive current in the power transistors. Phase to phase or phase to ground short circuit 
on motor power output. Make sure the plug-in (gray faceplate) circuit board is securely 
seated in the amplifier base. Possible incorrect phase connection of the motor power wiring. 
Motor type code must be configured correctly in the GE Fanuc controller. Disconnect motor 
power leads from amplifier and reset E-stop condition. If IPM alarm occurs replace amplifier. 
If no IPM alarm the problem is in the motor or motor power cable. Check for electrical shorts 
in the motor power cable or motor winding shorted to frame ground. 

IPM Overheat  Issued when the temperature inside the amplifier becomes so high that the thermostat trips. 
Make sure the plug-in (gray faceplate) circuit board is securely seated in the amplifier base. 
Check that the heat sink cooling fan (if applicable) is running. Make sure the ambient 
temperature around the amplifier is 55oC or lower. Check that the motor load is within the 
rating of the motor. 

Motor Over-current Issued when an abnormally high current is detected in the main circuit. Make sure the plug-in 
(gray faceplate) circuit board is securely seated in the amplifier base. Check for electrical 
shorts in the motor power cable or motor winding shorted to frame ground. Possible incorrect 
phasing on motor power wiring. Motor type code may be configured incorrectly in the 
DSM324 controller. Possible excessive force loading on motor. 

FSSB 
Communication 
Error 

FSSB connector or cable failure. Check the connections to the COP10A and COP10B 
connectors. Try replacing the optical cable. Replace amplifier.

19.5 Absolute Encoder Battery Options 
All βis and βHVis Series servomotors feature a built-in encoder that can be used in either incremental or 
absolute mode. To utilize the absolute capability, an optional encoder battery pack must be installed. This 
pack allows the encoder’s position information to be maintained so that the machine does not need to be re-
referenced to a home position every time power is restored to the servo system. 

The encoder for βis 0.4 to 22 Nm motors and all βHVis motors contains an integral capacitor that will maintain 
the encoder backup voltage for approximately 10 minutes. This allows battery change without loss of absolute 
position data. 

There are two encoder battery backup options for the βi and βHVi Series amplifiers. A snap-on lithium battery 
pack that will support a single amplifier or a panel mounted battery pack for up to four amplifiers that uses 
standard D cell alkaline batteries. 

For optimal panel space utilization, a small lithium battery pack IC800BBK021 is available that snaps onto the 
βi and βHVi Series amplifiers housing (see figure below). An integral pigtail cable plugs directly into the CX5X 
connector on the faceplate of the amplifier. One battery is required for each βi or βHVi Series amplifier. The 
lithium battery service life is approximately 2 years. 

The Absolute Encoder Battery Kit (IC800BBK021) contains the following: 

 Qty 1 - Battery (ZA06B-6093-K001) 

 Qty 1 - Battery Holder (ZA06B-6093-K002) 

Connection Method for Single Amplifiers 
(IC800BBK021 for use with a single amplifier) 

Installation 
1. Make sure 24V control power is applied to the amplifier (if trying to hold position on an existing system) 

2. Place system in an E-stop condition 

3. Remove AC power from the amplifier 

4. Remove the old battery (if applicable) 

5. Place battery into plastic cover 

6. Snap cover onto amplifier housing 

7. Attach battery cable to amplifier CX5X connector as indicated in diagram making sure polarity is correct. 

Note 
 Do not attempt to connect multiple amplifiers to one IC800BBK021 battery kit.  
 Replacement CX5 battery connectors are available as kit number

Servo Products Specification Guide 

 

III-28  Servo Products Specification Guide –  October 2007 GFH-001F 

Connection Method for Multiple Amplifiers 
To utilize the absolute capability for multiple amplifiers (βSVM1-20i, βSVM1-40i, βSVM1-10HVi or 
βSVM1-20HVi) the IC800ABK001 panel mounted battery pack must be installed.  

The Absolute Encoder Battery Kit (IC800ABK001) contains the following: 

 One battery holder (ZA06B-6050-K060) 

 Four D-cell, alkaline batteries (ZA98L-0031-0005) 

One kit provides battery backup for up to four absolute encoders. The user is responsible for manufacturing 
the cable used to connect the battery pack to the amplifier. The battery connection is made to the CXA19B 
connector on the last amplifier in the sequence supported by the battery pack. Terminals CXA19B-B3 (6V) 
and CXA19B-A2 (0V) are used and wire should be 0.3 mm2 minimum cross sectional area. The battery power 
is distributed to the other amplifiers in the sequence by daisy chaining the CXA19A connections to the 
CXA19B connections on adjacent amplifiers. See 39HSection 24:40Hβi and βHVi Series Servo System Connection 
for more detail. 

The battery service life is approximately one year and we recommend a yearly replacement schedule. 

The IC800ABK001 battery pack is panel-mounted and requires a cutout in the mounting surface. Mounting 
dimensions and terminal designations are shown below.

Section 20: Installation Guidelines 
This section includes environmental requirements, motor and amplifier dimension drawings and information 
on ensuring noise protection and selecting a ground fault interrupter. 

20.1 βis and βHVis Motor Environmental Requirements   
The servomotor must be installed in a location that satisfies the following environmental conditions: 
Table 42HIII-12. Servo Motor Environmental Conditions 

Condition Description 
Ambient temperature The ambient temperature should be 0°C to 40°C. When operating the motor at a 

temperature higher than 40°C, it is necessary to de-rate the output power so that the 
motor’s and the encoder’s temperature rating is not exceeded. 

Ambient humidity Should be 80% RH (relative humidity) or less, non-condensing 
Vibration When installed in a machine, the vibration applied to the motor must not exceed 5G. 
Altitude No more than 1,000 m (3,300 ft) above sea level. 
Drip-Proof Environment  The motors have a drip-proof structure that complies with IP65 of the IEC standard. 

Nevertheless, to ensure long-term performance, the motor surface should be 
protected from solvents, lubricants, and fluid spray. A cover should be used when 
there is a possibility of wetting the motor surface. Also, to prevent fluid from being led 
to the motor through the cable, put a drip loop in the cable when the motor is mounted. 
Finally, turn the motor connector sideways or downward as far as possible. If the cable 
connector will be subjected to moisture, it is recommended that an R class or 
waterproof plug be used. For additional information, see GE Fanuc publication Servo 
and Spindle Motors Exposed to Liquids, GFK-1046.

III-30  Servo Products Specification Guide –  October 2007 GFH-001F 

20.2 βis & βHVis Servo Amplifier Environmental Requirements 
The servo amplifier must be installed in a location that satisfies the environmental conditions identified in the 
table below. 

Table 44HIII-13. Servo Amplifier Environmental Conditions 

Condition Description 
Ambient temperature 0°C to 55°C (operating). 

-20°C to 60°C (storage and transportation). 
Temperature fluctuation Within 1.1°C/min. 
Humidity 90% RH (non-condensing) or lower. 
Altitude No more than 1000 m (3,300 ft) above sea level. 
Vibration No more than 0.5 G during operation. 
Atmosphere The circuitry and cooling fins must not be exposed to any 

corrosive and conductive vapor or liquid. 

The amplifier must be installed in a cabinet that protects it from contaminants such as dust, coolant, organic 
solvents, acid, corrosive gas, and salt. Adequate protection must also be provided for applications where the 
amplifier could be exposed to radiation, such as microwave, ultraviolet, laser light, or x-rays. 

To adequately protect the amplifier, you must ensure that: 

 Contaminants such as dust and fluid cannot enter through the air inlet or outlet. 
 The flow of cooling air is not obstructed. 
 The amplifier can be accessed for inspection. 
 The amplifier can be disassembled for maintenance and later reinstalled. 
 There is sufficient separation between the power and signal lines to avoid interference. Noise 

protection should be provided. 

 

 
 
 

NOTE 
Attach the accompanying gasket around the 
panel cutout to prevent oil and dust from getting 
in. Reinforce the right and left sides of the panel 
cutout by using fittings such as angles to 
maintain satisfactory contact between the cabinet 
and the amplifier.

20.3 βi and βHVi Amplifier Heat Dissipation and Maintenance 
Clearance 

The amplifier may contain a cooling fan that forces air through the unit. Allow for adequate clearance for 
airflow when installing the amplifier using the recommended distances shown in the drawings below. If 
possible, do not mount amplifiers one above the other unless they are staggered to prevent the heated 
exhaust of the lower unit from flowing over the upper unit.

Section 21: Heat Dissipation 
Table 48H50HIII-14 identifies worst-case heat dissipation values for each amplifier. These values may be used to 
determine heat load for sizing enclosures and cooling equipment. Heat dissipation for external regeneration 
resistors depends on the application and is calculated in 49H23.7, Step 5. 

The total heat dissipation is a function of the amplifier base dissipation (a) plus the amplifier heat coefficient 
(K) times the heat generated by RMS stall current flowing through the servo motor (b). 

Total heat dissipation Watts = a + (K * b)

Section 22: Noise Protection 

22.1 Separation of Signal and Power Lines 
When routing signal and power lines, the signal lines must be separated from the power lines to ensure best 
noise immunity. The table below lists the types of cables used: 

Table 51HIII-15. Servo amplifier signal line separation  

Group Signal Action 

A Amplifier input power line, 
motor power line, MCC drive 
coil 

Separate these cables from those of group B by bundling them 
separately* or by means of electromagnetic shielding**. Attach a noise 
suppressor (spark arrester) to the MCC drive coil. 

B Cable connecting control unit 
with servo amplifier and serial 
encoder feedback cable 

Separate these cables from those of group A by bundling them separately 
or by means of electromagnetic shielding**. In addition, shielding must be 
provided. 

* The bundle of group A cables must be separated from the bundle of group B cables by at least 10 cm.  
** Electromagnetic shielding involves shielding groups from each other by means of a grounded metal (steel) plate. 

22.2 Grounding 
A typical machine has three separate grounds: 

 Signal Ground: Provides the reference potential (0 V) for the electrical signal system. 
 Frame Ground: Ensures safety and shields external and internal noise. 
 System Ground: Connects each unit and the inter-unit frame ground system to earth ground.

Servo Products Specification Guide 

 

Part III: βi and βHVi Series Servo Systems  III-35 

Notes on the ground system wiring: 
 The ground resistance of the system ground must not exceed 100 ohms (Class-3 ground). 

 System ground connection cables must have a sufficiently large cross-sectional area to enable them to 
safely carry the current that will arise in the event of a problem such as a short-circuit (in general, a cross-
sectional area no less than that of the AC power line must be provided). 

 The system ground connection cable must be integrated with the AC power line such that power cannot 
be supplied if the ground wire is disconnected. 

 The SVM1-20i CZ7-3 motor power connector servo motor frame ground connection on pin A2 should 
always be installed.  

 The motor frame must be referenced to earth ground with a class 3 (100 ohms or less) system ground. 
Use an ohmmeter to measure the resistance from the servomotor frame to a known earth ground rod or 
grid. When using the 20 amp amplifier (SVM-20i), the servo motor frame ground connection on connector 
CZ7-3 pin A2 should always be installed. The frame-to-ground resistance should be within 1 to 2 ohms.  

In a high noise environment, installing a ground wire on the motor frame and routing it directly to the 
nearest available earth ground can improve noise immunity. Some servo motors have a tapped hole on 
the frame or a blind hole that can be tapped. For smaller motors, connect to the motor mounting bolts. 

 The Motor Power cable should not be a shielded cable. If a custom built cable with shield was used for 
motor power, lift the shield connection at both ends of the cable. If a shield is attached, especially at the 
motor end, it acts as an antenna to couple noise into the encoder. 

 The Motor Feedback cable should have the Z44B295864-001 Grounding Bar and one ZA99L-0035-001 
Grounding Clamp per axis installed near the amplifier. Confirm that the grounding bar is referenced to 
earth ground with a class 3 (100 ohms or less) system ground. Use an ohmmeter to measure the 
resistance from the grounding bar frame to a known earth ground rod or grid. The frame to ground 
resistance should be within 1 to 2 ohms. 

In a high noise environment, installing a ferrous bead on the feedback cable within a short distance of the 
amplifier connector can also improve noise immunity. 

 Separation of Motor Power and Motor Feedback cables: Group A signals (Amplifier main AC power, 
Motor Power Cable and MCC drive coil) signals must be separated from Group B signals (Motor 
Feedback cable) by at least a 10cm distance. Do not tie Group A and B signals together with cable ties or 
wraps at any point. An alternative is to separate these two groups by means of a grounded metal (steel) 
plate. 

 The MCC relay used to switch the three-phase AC main power to the amplifier should have an 
appropriate noise (spark arrester) on its drive coil. 

 The 24VDC power supply used to supply the logic power to the amplifiers should be a regulated supply 
free of excessive noise. If possible examine the DC voltage with an oscilloscope for noise. If a 24 VDC 
motor-mounted holding brake is used, it should not use the same power supply as the control logic 
power. 



Servo Products Specification Guide 

 

III-36  Servo Products Specification Guide –  October 2007 GFH-001F 

 An AC line filter is recommended to suppress high frequency line noise on the amplifier main power lines. 
When an isolation transformer is used to convert AC main power to amplifier input power levels, the AC 
line filter is not required. GE Fanuc supplies an acceptable three-phase line filter sized for 5.4KW or 
10.5KW especially for this purpose. This filtered AC main power should not be shared with other 
equipment in the panel, especially with devices such as inverter drives or motor starters that have high 
power consumption. 

 Amplifier Chassis Ground must be referenced to earth ground with a class 3 (100 ohm or less) system 
ground. User an ohmmeter to measure the resistance from the amplifier frame to a known earth ground 
rod or grid. A tapped and threaded hole is provided on the amplifier frame for this purpose. 

 AC Main PE Ground is supplied in accordance to local code practices and may vary, depending on AC 
power distribution in the facility. In general the PE ground should be referenced to an earth ground and 
not indicate common mode voltage to the instrumentation earth ground. 



Servo Products Specification Guide 

 

Part III: βi and βHVi Series Servo Systems  III-37 

22.3 Encoder Feedback Cable Grounding 
The βis Series motor encoder feedback cable shielding should be grounded by the method shown below. 
This cable clamp treatment provides both cable support (strain relief) and proper grounding of the shield. To 
ensure stable system operation, the cable clamp method is recommended. Partially peel back the cable 
sheath to expose the shield. Push the clamp (ZA99L-0035-0001) over the exposed shield and insert the 
clamp hooks into slots on the grounding bar (Z44B295864-001). Tighten the clamp to secure cable and 
complete the ground connection. The grounding bar must be attached to a low impedance earth ground.

III-38  Servo Products Specification Guide –  October 2007 GFH-001F 

Section 23: βi and βHVi Servo System Power Requirements 
This section provides information about AC and DC amplifier power as well as the discharge of regenerative 
power. 

23.1 Power Line Protection  
A circuit breaker, electromagnetic contactor, and AC line filter or transformer should be installed as part of 
your βi and βHVi Series Servo system. GE Fanuc provides the AC line filter as an option. The transformer, 
circuit breaker, and electromagnetic contactor, however, are user-supplied components. In European 
countries where power sources are 380 to 400 VAC and neutral grounded, it is necessary to install a 
transformer or supply single-phase power for the βi Series amplifiers. 

The same incoming AC control components can be used to provide power to multiple amplifiers, as long as 
the components are rated for the current and power drawn by the sum of all of the amplifiers. 

23.2 AC Line Filter 
An AC line filter is recommended to suppress the influences of high-frequency input line noise on the drive 
power supply. When an isolation-type power transformer is used because a power supply voltage within the 
specified range is not available, an AC line filter is not required. 

If two or more servo amplifiers are connected to one AC line filter, the total continuous output rating of all 
connected servo amplifiers should be kept below the continuous output rating of the AC line filter. The 
continuous output rating for the various servos are shown below. 

Table 55HIII-16. βis Servo Motor Continuous Output Rating at Low Line of 200 VAC

β8/3000is 1.2 KW    

β12/3000is 1.8 KW    

β22/2000is 2.5 KW    

If your installation must be EMC compliant, verify that the use of an AC line filter fully satisfies the EMC 
requirements. You may need to select and install a user-supplied noise filter to meet EMC requirements.  

AC line filters are available for GE Fanuc servo amplifiers: 

AC Line Filter Use With

23.3 Circuit Breaker Selection 
To provide proper protection for the amplifier, use a circuit breaker rated at no more than 20 Amps (10A for 
VDE 1601 compliance for CE marking). Table 56H57HIII-17 will help you select the appropriate circuit breaker for your 
motion application.

Note: 
When multiple amplifiers are connected to a single circuit breaker, select a 
breaker by multiplying the sum of the currents listed in Table 58H57HIII-17 by 
0.6. (This factor attempts to compensate for applications where all axes 
are not demanding full power at the same time. In applications where all 
axes are running continuously or with high duty cycles, this factor must be 
increased to 1.) 
Example: Connecting two β8/3000is motors operating on 3-phase power: 
(6.3 + 6.3) x 0.6 = 7.6 Arms 
A standard 10 Amp circuit breaker can be used. 
During rapid motor acceleration, a peak current that is three times the 
continuous rating flows. Select a circuit breaker that does not trip when a 
current that is three times the continuous rating flows for two seconds. 

 

23.4 Electromagnetic Contactor Rating 
To prepare for incoming AC power, you must also select and install an appropriate electromagnetic contactor, 
based on the peak currents for the motors in your system. When multiple amplifiers are connected to a single 
circuit breaker, select a breaker based on the sum of the motor currents in Table 59H57HIII-17.

AC Power Ratings 
The power supply rating required when using multiple servo motors can be determined by summing the 
requirements of the individual motors. 

The power supply ratings listed in Table 61H62HIII-19 are sufficient as continuous ratings. Note, however, that servo 
motor acceleration causes a current to momentarily flow that is approximately three times the continuous 
current rating. 

When the power is turned on, a surge current of about 37A (when 264VAC is applied) flows for 20 msec.

23.6 Incoming DC Power 
The βi and βHVi amplifiers require a 24 VDC power supply for amplifier control power. The user must supply 
this DC power supply. 

The information in Table 63H64HIII-20 below will help you select the appropriate DC power supply for your motion 
application. 

The same external DC power supply can be used to provide power to multiple amplifiers as long as the 
supply is rated for the sum of power drawn by all of the amplifiers. To daisy chain the amplifiers, add 
connections between connector CXA19A and CXA19B on adjacent amplifiers (see the connection diagrams 
for more details). Up to 8 amplifiers can be daisy chained when using 16 AWG wire or up to 6 amplifiers when 
using 20 AWG wire.

Specification Description 
Input voltage 24V DC (±10%) 
Power supply rating (per amplifier) 0.9 amps 

24 VDC Fuse Locations 
The 24 VDC input is fused to protect the amplifier. The fuse labeled FU1 is located on the gray control board 
that plugs into the front of the amplifier. The diagrams below show the location on this board for each 
amplifier model. The replacement fuse part number is ZA06B-6073-K250 (Manufacturer: Daito LM32, DC48V, 
F3.2A). 

A spare fuse is included with each βi series amplifier package (IC800BIK020, IC800BIK040, IC800BIHV010 
or IC800BIHV020).

23.7 Discharging Regenerative Energy 
Regenerative energy is normally created in applications with a high load inertia or frequent acceleration and 
deceleration. When decelerating a load, the stored kinetic energy of the load causes generator action in the 
motor causing energy to be returned to the amplifier. For light loads and low acceleration rates, the amplifier 
may be able to absorb this energy. Otherwise, an optional external regenerative discharge unit must be 
installed. This optional regeneration capability extends the functionality of the amplifier when working with 
loads and move profiles that require more capacity than is internal. Calculations shown later in this section 
can be used to determine the need for an external unit. 

If the regenerative discharge unit overheats, a built-in thermostat is tripped, the external overheat alarm is 
issued, and the motor is stopped. If an external regenerative discharge unit is required, a separate unit must 
be installed for each amplifier. This component cannot be daisy-chained.  

βSVM1-20i Amplifier Regeneration Options 
For the βSVM1-20i amplifier, two optional separate 30-Ohm regenerative discharge units are available with 
power ratings of 100 W and 20 W. The 100 W unit (ZA06B-6130-H402) is panel-mounted, whereas the 20 W 
unit (ZA06B-6130-H401) mounts to the tapped holes on the side of the amplifier heat sink. The dimensions 
and connections for both units are shown in the connection section of this document.  

NOTE 

The amplifiers include an input on connector CXA20 (DCOH) for a 
normally closed thermal overload switch to protect the external 
regeneration resistor from overheating. If an external resistor is not 
used this input must be connected with a wire jumper or the amplifier 
will generate a fault and will not run. 

 

βSVM1-40i Amplifier Regeneration Options 
For this amplifier, two optional regeneration units are available. Both regeneration modules are panel 
mounted.

βSVM1-40i, βSVM1-10HVi and βSVM1-20HVi Switch Settings 
There are four switches located on the front of the βSVM1-40i, βSVM1-10HVi and βSVM1-20HVi series servo 
amplifiers that configure the amplifier for the regenerative resistor option used. These switches should be set 
as described below before using these servo amplifiers. 

WARNING: 

If the switch settings are not correct it is possible to damage the 
regenerative resistor and it will be impossible to normally detect a 
regenerative overheat alarm.

Regenerative Discharge Unit Dimensions 
The separate regenerative discharge units are designed with a rear-mounted heat sink that extends through a 
hole in the mounting plate. The intent is that the user will construct a control cabinet with an internal air 
plenum into which the heat sinks for the βSVM1-40i amplifiers and associated regenerative discharge units 
will be mounted. This design eliminates most of the heat dissipation from these units inside the control 
cabinet.

Calculating the Average Regenerative Energy 
Use the following calculation to determine the average regenerative energy that will be released in your 
application (ambient temperature is assumed not to exceed 55°C). Based on the calculations select 
either the internal regeneration or optional external regeneration resistor. The wattage rating of the 
selected resistor must exceed the average calculated regenerative energy from the equation below:

smaller value) 

(%) 

STEP 4: Determine if a Regenerative Discharge Unit Is Required 

Determine the Average Regenerative Energy using the equation in the beginning of this section. 

When the average regenerative energy produced never exceeds the amounts indicated in the table 
below, a separate regenerative discharge unit is not required: 



Servo Products Specification Guide 

 

III-48  Servo Products Specification Guide –  October 2007 GFH-001F 

Table 70HIII-22. Maximum Allowable Regenerative Energy for Amplifiers 

Amplifier Max. Allowable Regen. Energy 

βSVM1-20i 16 Joules 

βSVM1-40i 50 Watts 

βSVM1-10HVi 50 Watts 

βSVM1-20HVI 50 Watts 

If the calculated value exceeds the storage capability of the amplifier, then an external regenerative 
discharge unit is required (see Step 5). 

STEP 5: Selecting a Regenerative Discharge Unit 
If a separate regenerative discharge unit is required, the following calculation will determine the unit 
required:  

 Average Regenerative Power (W) = Average Regenerative Energy (Joules) x 
F
1

 where: 

F = Deceleration duty  (seconds) Example: deceleration once per 5 second cycle, F=5 

Select a regenerative resistor with a rating that exceeds the average regenerative power.  

Example:  
Assume a horizontal axis using a β2/4000is motor (Jm = 0.0002146 lb-in-s2) that decelerates once every 6 
seconds (F) for 0.2 seconds (ta) with a maximum speed of 2000 RPM (ωm). The machine inertia (JL) is 
0.00139 lb-in-s2. 
STEP 1:  Rotational Energy = (6.19x10-4)x(0.0002146+0.00139)x20002 = 3.97 Joules  
 

STEP 2:  Assuming TL = 10 in-lb: 
            Friction Energy = (5.91x10-3)x0.2x2000x10 = 23.64 Joules 
 

Therefore: 
STEP 4: Average Regenerative Energy = 3.97–23.64 = 27.61 Joules  

Because the 27.61 Joules required is more than the 16 Joules allowed by the βSVM1-20i 
amplifier used with the β2is motor, an external regenerative resistor is required. 

STEP 5: Since the application requires decelerations every 6 seconds, 
F
1

 = 
6
1

 

 Average Regenerative Power = 27.61 Joules/6 seconds = 4.6 W  
Therefore, the 20 W resistor (ZA06B-6130-H401) is adequate for this application.

24.1 Connectors on the Motor Side  
For the FANUC AC Servo Motor βis series, a TÜV-approved connector is used as the power line 
connector to meet the IEC60034 standard. 

 The power connector for β0.2is and β0.3is is not drip proof. 

 The power connectors for β0.4is to β4is are drip proof when engaged with the cable connector. 

 As the power connectors for β8is to β22is, receptacle connectors, which are drip proof by 
themselves (when not engaged), are used as standard. The power connectors for β8is and β22is 
are compatible with MS standard round connectors, though they do not strictly conform to the MS 
standard. 

 The signal connector for β0.2is and β0.3is is not drip proof. 

 The signal connector for β0.4is to β22is is drip proof when engaged with the cable connector. 
(When the motor cable is not connected, the connector is drip proof when the protective cap 
mounted to the connector at shipment is installed.)

CAUTION  
1. The motors should be installed with their connector facing downward, if 

possible. When it is impossible to install a motor in this position, allow slack in 
the cable to keep liquids such as a dielectric fluid from going along the cable 
into the cable or motor. If there is a possibility that the motors and connectors 
will get wet, provide a cover to protect them.  

2. If a motor is not connected to the earth ground through the machine (frame), 
connect the motor grounding point and the amplifier grounding point to absorb 

noise using a 1.25 mm
2
 or larger conductor other than the grounding 

conductor in the power cable. Keep the grounding conductor as far from the 
power cable as possible.

24.8 Brake Connectors on the Cable Side (models β8is to 
β22is and β8HVis to β22HVis)  

The models β8is to β22is use a dedicated connector to connect the built-in brake cable. This connector is 
dripproof. It is connected by soldering, so no special tool is required. Consider soldering, cable clamp, 
and voltage drop. Also note that there are restrictions.

Details of Cable K6 – 24V, E-Stop and Battery Daisy Chain for Multi-Axis Systems 
For multi-axis systems, the 24VDC control power, emergency stop, and absolute encoder backup battery 
signals can be daisy chained from the first amplifier to up to four adjacent amplifiers using the CXA19 
connections. The state of the E-stop input signal on connector CX30 on the first amplifier is passed to the 
other connected amplifiers, allowing an emergency stop condition to be executed on all amplifiers 
simultaneously. When using this connection for the encoder battery backup, the IC800ABK001 multi-axis 
battery kit must be connected to the first amplifier. Do not use the IC800BBK021 single-axis battery kit.

This cable is used to connect the normally open relay contacts on connector CX29 to the power source of 
the magnetic contactor coil used to interrupt AC power to the amplifier when an amplifier fault occurs or 
E-stop condition occurs. 

The relay contact will close when the amplifier is enabled by the DSM324i controller (MCON signal sent) 
as long as there are no active servo alarms and the E-stop input on connector CX30 is closed. The relay 
contacts will open when any one or more of the following conditions occurs: 

1. 24 VDC power is removed from the amplifier. 

2. A servo alarm occurs on the amplifier. 

3. The emergency stop input (CX30) to the amplifier is opened. 

4. DSM324i enable (MCON) is 0.

Section 25: αi and αHVi Series Servos Overview 

25.1 αi and αHVi Series Servo Systems 
The α HVi Series servos are high voltage models with an AC voltage input range of 400-480 VAC and 
include separately mounted shared power supply modules. These power supply modules offer line 
regenation capability which eliminates the need for external power resistors to dissipate regenerated 
energy during motor deceleration. Depending on the motor rating up to six amplifiers can be connected to 
one power supply.  

Table 0H2HIV-1 provides a summary of αis Series servo motors supported by the DSM324i and PACMotion 
controllers for general motion applications. See 1HSection 27: for more detailed motor specifications.

27.2 αi and αHVis Series Motor Speed–Torque Curves 
The curves shown in the following figure illustrate the relationship between the speed of the motor and 
the output torque. The motor can operate continuously at any combination of speed and torque within the 
prescribed continuous operating zone. The limit of the continuous operating zone is determined with the 
motor’s ambient temperature at 20°C and its drive current as pure sine wave. The curves reflect peak 
torque limits based on maximum current of the servo amplifier unit.

27.4 Built-in Brake 
The built-in holding brake is used to prevent movement on horizontal axes or falling along the vertical axis 
when the servo motor control is turned off. Brakes are spring-set and electrically released and are 
designed for holding stationary loads only. Using the holding brake to stop a moving axis may damage 
the brake or severely reduce its service life. 

The specifications of the built-in brakes are listed in the following table.

Servo Products Specification Guide 

 

IV-16  Servo Products Specification Guide –  October 2007 GFH-001F 

1. Use a 24 VDC power supply as the power supply for the αi series servo motor brake. Power 
(equivalent to 24 Vrms) produced by full-wave rectification after transforming commercial power 
(50 Hz/60 Hz) is also available. 

2. Use a power supply separate from the 24-V power supply for the amplifier as the power supply for the 
brake. If the control power supply is also used for the brake, an amplifier malfunction or another 
danger may occur. The power supply for a relay, solenoid, or another peripheral device can be used 
for the brake. Be careful of the power capacity and changes in voltage due to changes in load. 

3. For full-wave rectification, transform the secondary side voltage obtained during energization of the 
brake into approximately 29VAC by taking voltage drop in the rectifier or cable into account. 

In this case, check the power capacity and power voltage fluctuations sufficiently and then make sure 
the fluctuations of the voltage applied to the brake during energization falls within 24 Vrms ±10%. 
Switch the transformer's primary side input to a desired position such as 100-110-120 VAC or 200-
220-240 VAC. 

4. If the contact is installed on the DC side (at the position shown in the figure), the life of the contact is 
generally shortened due to the surge voltage at brake off. Provide an adequate contact capacity and 
always use a surge absorber and spark killer for protecting the contact. 

5. You can use either positive or negative power pin to connect the brake because the brake coil is 
nonpolarized. 

6. Use a shielded cable as required. 

Caution 
Observe the following precautions when motors with built-in brakes are used. 

1. A built-in brake is used as a holding brake to prevent a vertical axis from falling 
or a horizontal axis from being moved when torque is removed from the motor. 
This brake functions as a brake at an emergency stop or power failure, but 
should not be used to decrease the stop distance during ordinary deceleration. 

2. The brake cannot be used to assist stopping the motor under servo control. 
This causes abnormal heating of the motor. 

3. Match the timing of brake release (axis release) to the timing of servo on 
(motor energization) as much as possible. Similarly, match the timing of brake 
engagement to the timing of servo off as much as possible. 

4. The total length of a motor with a built-in brake is much longer than that of the 
motor with no built-in brake. Be careful not to apply excessive force to the 
opposite side of the mounting flange or to apply excessive acceleration to the 
entire motor.

28.2 αHVi Series Amplifier Status LED and Alarm Functions 
The servo amplifier unit can detect error conditions and provide alarm information. 

The LEDs on the front of the amplifier provide a visual indication of system status by indicating, for 
example, when the motor and amplifier are ready to function.  

 POWER LED (green) indicates the logic 24 VDC power is present. 

 DC LINK CHARGED LED (red) indicates that the amplifier has high (motor) voltage DC present. 

 LINK LED (green) indicates that the FSSB (fiber optic) interface is functioning.  

 ALM LED (yellow) is turned ON when an alarm condition is detected. When an alarm is detected, 
power is dropped and the motor is stopped by dynamic braking action. Alarm information is 
additionally displayed as diagnostic data in the GE Fanuc DSM324i motion controller. The 
amplifier control power must be cycled to reset this alarm state. The table below details the alarm 
conditions the αi Series Servo Amplifier can detect. 



Servo Products Specification Guide 

 

Part IV: αi and αHVi Series Servo Systems  IV-21 

Table 37HIV-15. αHVi Series Servo Amplifier Alarms 

Alarm Condition Description 

DC Link Under-Voltage  Issued when the DC voltage in the main circuit power supply is abnormally low. 
Indicates low AC mains power dip or hardware problem. Make sure the plug-in (gray 
faceplate) circuit board is securely seated in the amplifier base. Replace amplifier. 

DC Link Over-Voltage Issued when the DC voltage in the main circuit power supply is abnormally high. 
Indicates high AC mains power or hardware problem. Make sure the plug-in (gray 
faceplate) circuit board is securely seated in the amplifier base. May also be caused 
by excessive regenerated power. Increase acceleration/deceleration time and/or 
add additional regenerative discharge capacity. Replace amplifier. 

Excessive Deceleration 
Power 

If no external regeneration resistor is used, the discharge resistor thermal sensor 
jumper is missing on connector CXA20. This input requires a normally closed 
contact for normal operation.  

When using an external regeneration resistor, the thermal sensor in the 
regeneration resistor has tripped. Indicating excessive regenerated power load to 
the regeneration resistor. Use a meter to confirm an open circuit on the thermal 
sensor leads. Make sure the plug-in (gray faceplate) circuit board is securely seated 
in the amplifier base. Increase capacity of external regeneration resistor or decrease 
deceleration rate or frequency, and/or the top speed from which the axis must 
decelerate.  

Control Power Under-
Voltage 

The 24 VDC control power is below 21.6 VDC. Check the supply voltage level and 
make sure the CXA19A and CXA19B connectors are secure and associated cables 
are wired correctly. Replace amplifier. 

Internal Cooling Fan 
Stopped 

Fan is jammed, has failed or is not connected. Check for foreign material in fan 
blades. Make sure fan is plugged in. Make sure the plug-in (gray faceplate) circuit 
board is securely seated in the amplifier base. Replace amplifier. 

IPM Alarm Excessive current in the power transistors. Phase to phase or phase to ground short 
circuit on motor power output. Make sure the plug-in (gray faceplate) circuit board is 
securely seated in the amplifier base. Possible incorrect phase connection of the 
motor power wiring. Motor type code must be configured correctly in the GE Fanuc 
controller. Disconnect motor power leads from amplifier and reset E-stop condition. 
If IPM alarm occurs replace amplifier. If no IPM alarm the problem is in the motor or 
motor power cable. Check for electrical shorts in the motor power cable or motor 
winding shorted to frame ground. 

IPM Overheat  Issued when the temperature inside the amplifier becomes so high that the 
thermostat trips. Make sure the plug-in (gray faceplate) circuit board is securely 
seated in the amplifier base. Check that the heat sink cooling fan (if applicable) is 
running. Make sure the ambient temperature around the amplifier is 55oC or lower. 
Check that the motor load is within the rating of the motor. 

Motor Over-current Issued when an abnormally high current is detected in the main circuit. Make sure 
the plug-in (gray faceplate) circuit board is securely seated in the amplifier base. 
Check for electrical shorts in the motor power cable or motor winding shorted to 
frame ground. Possible incorrect phasing on motor power wiring. Motor type code 
may be configured incorrectly in the DSM324 or PACMotion controller. Possible 
excessive force loading on motor. 

FSSB Communication Error FSSB connector or cable failure. Check the connections to the COP10A and 
COP10B connectors. Try replacing the optical cable. Replace amplifier.

28.6 Absolute Encoder Battery Options 
The αi, αHVi and αHVis Series servomotors feature a built-in absolute encoder that requires an encoder 
battery pack. This pack allows the encoder’s position information to be maintained so that the machine 
does not need to be re-referenced to a home position every time power is restored to the servo system. 

The encoder contains an integral capacitor that will maintain the encoder backup voltage for 
approximately 10 minutes. This allows battery change without loss of absolute position data. 

There are two encoder battery backup options for the αHVi Series amplifiers: 

 a snap-on lithium battery pack that will support a single amplifier 

 a panel mounted battery pack for up to four amplifiers that uses standard D cell alkaline batteries.

* Includes the lithium battery pack and battery holder. Replacement battery packs can be ordered 
separately. 

Battery Connection Method for Single Amplifiers 
For optimal panel space utilization, a small lithium battery pack IC800ABK002 or IC800ABK003 is 
available that snaps onto the amplifier housing (see figure below). An integral pigtail cable plugs directly 
into the CX5X connector on the faceplate of the amplifier. One battery is required for each amplifier. The 
lithium battery service life is approximately two years. 

Installation 
1. Make sure 24V control power is applied to the amplifier (if trying to hold position on an existing 

system). 

2. Place system in an E-stop condition. 

3. Remove AC power from the amplifier. 

4. Remove the old battery (if applicable). 

5. Place battery into plastic cover. 

6. Snap cover onto amplifier housing. 

7. Attach battery cable to amplifier CX5X connector as indicated in diagram making sure polarity is 
correct. 

Notes: 

 Do not attempt to connect multiple amplifiers to one IC800ABK002 or

 One battery holder (ZA06B-650-K060) 

 Four D-cell, alkaline batteries (ZA98L-0031-0005) 

One kit provides battery backup for up to four absolute encoders. The user is responsible for 
manufacturing the cable used to connect the battery pack to the amplifier. The battery connection is 
made to the CXA2A connector on the last amplifier in the sequence supported by the battery pack. 
Terminals CXA2A-B3 (6V) and CXA2A-A2 (0V) are used and wire should be 0.3 mm2 minimum cross 
sectional area. The battery power is distributed to the other amplifiers in the sequence by daisy chaining 
the CXA2B connections to the CXA2A connections on adjacent amplifiers. See 45HSection 33:46HαHVi Series 
Servo System Connection for more detail. 

The battery service life is approximately one year and we recommend a yearly replacement schedule. 

The IC800ABK001 battery pack is panel-mounted and requires a cutout in the mounting surface.

Section 29: Installation Guidelines 
This section includes environmental requirements, motor and amplifier dimension drawings and 
information on ensuring noise protection and selecting a ground fault interrupter. 

29.1 αi, αHVi and αHVis Motor Environmental Requirements  
The servomotor must be installed in a location that satisfies the following environmental conditions: 
Table 48HIV-17. Servo Motor Environmental Conditions 

Condition Description 
Ambient temperature 0°C to 40°C 

When operating the motor at a temperature higher than 40°C, it is necessary to de-
rate the output power so that the motor’s and the encoder’s temperature rating is not 
exceeded. 

Ambient humidity Should be 80% relative humidity or less, non-condensing 
Vibration When installed in a machine, the vibration applied to the motor must not exceed 5G. 
Altitude Up to 1,000 meters (3,300 ft) above the sea level requires no particular provision for 

attitude. When operating the machine at a higher level, the maximum operating 
temperature should be lowered 1°C for every 100m higher than 1,000m. For example, 
when the machine is installed at 1,500 meters above sea level, the ambient 
temperature should be 35°C or less. 

Drip-Proof Environment  The motors have a drip-proof structure that complies with IP65 of the IEC standard. 
Nevertheless, to ensure long-term performance, the motor surface should be 
protected from solvents, lubricants, and fluid spray. A cover should be used when 
there is a possibility of wetting the motor surface. Also, to prevent fluid from being led 
to the motor through the cable, put a drip loop in the cable when the motor is mounted. 
Finally, turn the motor connector sideways or downward as far as possible. If the cable 
connector will be subjected to moisture, it is recommended that an R class or 
waterproof plug be used. For additional information, see GE Fanuc publication Servo 
and Spindle Motors Exposed to Liquids, GFK-1046.

IV-32  Servo Products Specification Guide –  October 2007 GFH-001F 

Cabinet Installation 
The amplifier must be installed in a cabinet that protects it from contaminants such as dust, coolant, 
organic solvents, acid, corrosive gas, and salt. Adequate protection must also be provided for 
applications where the amplifier could be exposed to radiation, such as microwave, ultraviolet, laser light, 
or x-rays. 

To adequately protect the amplifier, you must ensure that: 

 Contaminants such as dust and fluid cannot enter through the air inlet or outlet. 

 The flow of cooling air is not obstructed. 

 The amplifier can be accessed for inspection. 

 The amplifier can be disassembled for maintenance and later reinstalled. 

 There is sufficient separation between the power and signal lines to avoid interference. Noise 
protection should be provided. 

Note: Attach the accompanying gasket around the panel cutout to prevent oil and dust from getting in. 
Reinforce the right and left sides of the panel cutout by using fittings such as angles to maintain 
satisfactory contact between the cabinet and the amplifier.

29.3 Amplifier Heat Dissipation and Maintenance Clearance 
The amplifier may contain a cooling fan that forces air through the unit. Allow for adequate clearance for 
airflow when installing the amplifier using the recommended distances shown in the drawings below. If 
possible, do not mount amplifiers one above the other unless they are staggered to prevent the heated 
exhaust of the lower unit from flowing over the upper unit.

Section 30: Heat Dissipation 
Table 54H55HIV-19 identifies worst-case heat dissipation values for each amplifier. These values may be used to 
determine heat load for sizing enclosures and cooling equipment. 

The total heat dissipation is a function of the amplifier base dissipation (a) plus the amplifier heat 
coefficient (K) times the heat generated by RMS stall current flowing through the servo motor (b). 

Total heat dissipation, Watts = a + (K * b)

Section 31: Noise Protection 

31.1 Grounding 
A typical machine has three separate grounds: 

 Signal Ground: Provides the reference potential (0 V) for the electrical signal system. 
 Frame Ground: Ensures safety and shields external and internal noise. 
 System Ground: Connects each unit and the inter-unit frame ground system to earth ground.

Figure 56HIV-20.  Ground System  

Ground system wiring: 
 Connect the signal ground (0V) with the frame ground (FG) at only one place in the power supply 

module. 

 The grounding resistance of the system ground shall be 100 ohms or less (class D grounding). 

 The system ground cable must have enough cross-sectional area to safely carry the accidental 
current flow into the system ground when an accident such as a short circuit occurs. (Generally, it 
must have the cross-sectional area of the AC power cable or more.) 

 Use the cable containing the AC power wire and the system ground wire so that power is supplied 
with the ground wire connected. 



Servo Products Specification Guide 

 

IV-36  Servo Products Specification Guide –  October 2007 GFH-001F 

Grounding of Each Module 
 Separate the frame ground (FG) of the power system and that of the signal system. Otherwise, noise 

may propagate from the power system to the signal system, possibly causing the unit to malfunction. 

 Connect the ground terminal of the Power Supply’s CX1A connector to the frame ground. This acts 
as the signal ground. Connect the ground terminal of the metal frame to the frame ground. 

 Connect the ground cable of the motor power cable to a ground terminal of the Servo Amplifier’s 
terminal block. Connect the other ground terminal of the terminal block to the frame ground. Connect 
the ground terminal of the metal frame to the frame ground. 

 On the Regenerative Discharge Unit and Dynamic Brake Module, connect the ground terminal of the 
metal frame to the frame ground.  

Note: 

 Securing the ground terminal and a cable together is not permitted. 

 The motor flange mounting section may not be able to be connected to the machine mounting section 
of the power magnetics cabinet via the mechanical unit at sufficiently low impedance in a machine. In 
this case, a cable of a minimum required length that is at least 1.25 mm2 thick must be run from the 
motor flange to the frame ground of the power magnetics cabinet. The cable must also be separated 
from the motor power line as much as possible. 

31.2 Separation of Signal and Power Lines 
When routing signal and power lines, the signal lines must be separated from the power lines to ensure 
best noise immunity. The table below lists the types of cables used: 

Table 57HIV-20. Servo amplifier signal line separation  

Group Signal Type Action 
A Amplifier input power line 

Motor power line 
Magnetic contactor drive coil1 

Separate these cables from those of group B by bundling them 
separately2 or by means of electromagnetic shielding3. Attach a noise 
suppressor (spark arrester) to the MCC drive coil. 

B Cable connecting control unit 
with servo amplifier 
Serial encoder feedback cable 

Separate these cables from those of group A by bundling them 
separately* or by means of electromagnetic shielding**. In addition, 
shielding must be provided. 

1 Attach a noise suppressor such as a spark killer to the magnetic contactor drive coil. 
2 The bundle of group A cables must be separated from the bundle of group B cables by at least 10 cm.  
3 Electromagnetic shielding involves shielding groups from each other by means of a grounded metal (steel) plate. 



Servo Products Specification Guide 

 

Part IV: αi and αHVi Series Servo Systems  IV-37 

31.3 Cable Clamp and Shield Grounding 

Terminal processing of the shield sheaths 
Perform terminal processing of the shield sheaths of the signal cables according to the description in 
“ 58HαHVi Series Servo System Connection” on page IV- 59H46. 

Cable clamp 
The cables that run into the amplifier and which require shield processing must be clamped as indicated 
in Fig. 5.3.2(a). 

Clamping secures a cable and also provides shielding. Clamping must always be performed since it is 
very important for stable system operation. 

Strip part of the cable jacket to expose the shield sheath, as shown in the figure below. Secure that part 
of the cable to the ground plate by using a clamp. At this time, the ground plate must be in contact with 
the surface of the shield so that the contact area becomes wide. 

Connect each shield cable to the ground plate installed near the cabinet inlet by using a ground clamp. 
This prevents noise generated in the panel from being emitted to external devices. 

Connect the cable clamp of the signal cables of SVM connected to common PSM to common the ground 
plate for signals. 

Grounding 
The ground plate must be created and installed by the user as shown in Figure 60H61HIV-21.  

 



Servo Products Specification Guide 

 

IV-38  Servo Products Specification Guide –  October 2007 GFH-001F 

31.4 Encoder Feedback Cable Grounding 
The motor encoder feedback cable shielding should be grounded by the method shown below. This cable 
clamp treatment provides both cable support (strain relief) and proper grounding of the shield. To ensure 
stable system operation, the cable clamp method is recommended. Partially peel back the cable sheath 
to expose the shield. Push the clamp (ZA99L-0035-0001) over the exposed shield and insert the clamp 
hooks into slots on the grounding bar (Z44B295864-001). Tighten the clamp to secure cable and 
complete the ground connection. The grounding bar must be attached to a low impedance earth ground.

Section 32: αHVi Servo System Power Requirements 
This section provides information about AC and DC amplifier power as well as the discharge of 
regenerative power. 

32.1 Power Line Protection  
A circuit breaker, electromagnetic contactor, and AC line filter or transformer should be installed as part of 
your αHVi Series Servo system. GE Fanuc provides the AC line filter as an option. The transformer, 
circuit breaker, and electromagnetic contactor, however, are user-supplied components. In European 
countries where power sources are 380 to 400 VAC and neutral grounded, it is necessary to install a 
transformer or supply single-phase power for the αi Series amplifiers. 

The same incoming AC control components can be used to provide power to multiple amplifiers, as long 
as the components are rated for the current and power drawn by the sum of all of the amplifiers. 

32.2 AC Line Filter 
An AC line filter is recommended to suppress the influences of high-frequency input line noise on the 
drive power supply. When an isolation-type power transformer is used because a power supply voltage 
within the specified range is not available, an AC line filter is not required. 

If two or more servo amplifiers are connected to one AC line filter, the total continuous output rating of all 
connected servo amplifiers should be kept below the continuous output rating of the AC line filter. The 
continuous output rating for the various servos are shown below.

If your installation must be EMC compliant, verify that the use of an AC line filter fully satisfies the EMC 
requirements. You may need to select and install a user-supplied noise filter to meet EMC requirements.

32.3 Circuit Breaker and Magnetic Contactor Selection 
To provide proper protection for the amplifier, use a circuit breaker rated at no more than 20 Amps (10A 
for VDE 1601 compliance for CE marking). Table 69H71HIV-23 will help you select the appropriate circuit breaker 
for your motion application. 

To prepare for incoming AC power, you must also select and install an appropriate electromagnetic 
contactor, based on the peak currents for the motors in your system. When multiple amplifiers are 
connected to a single circuit breaker, select a breaker based on the sum of the motor currents in  
Table 70H71HIV-23.

Notes: 

 For the installation positions of the circuit breakers and magnetic contactor, see the sample 
configurations on pages 72HIV- 73H43 and 74HIV- 75H44. 

 Set the rated voltage of circuit breakers 1 and 2 according to the power supply voltage. 

 The current and voltage of the operation coil of the magnetic contactor must be within the rating 
of the internal contact CX3 (MCC) of the Power Supply. For details, see “Details of Cable K1” on 
page 76HIV- 77H61.

AC Power Ratings 
The power supply rating required when using multiple servo motors can be determined by summing the 
requirements of the individual motors. 

The power supply ratings listed in Table 79H80HIV-25 are sufficient as continuous ratings. Note, however, that 
servo motor acceleration causes a current to momentarily flow that is approximately three times the 
continuous current rating. 

When the power is turned on, a surge current of about 37A (when 264VAC is applied) flows for 20 msec.

CAUTION  
Motors should be installed with their connector facing downward if possible. When 
it is impossible to install a motor in this position, allow slack in the cable to keep 
liquids such as a dielectric fluid from flowing along the cable into the cable 
capacitor or motor. If there is a possibility that the motors and connectors will get 
wet, provide a cover to protect them.  

If a motor is not connected to the earth ground through the machine (frame), 
connect the motor grounding point and the amplifier grounding point to absorb 
noise using a 1.25 mm

2
 or larger conductor other than the grounding conductor in 

the power cable. Keep the grounding conductor as far from the power cable as 
possible.

Part IV: αi and αHVi Series Servo Systems  IV-49 

33.2 Encoder Connectors for αi, αHVi and αHVis Motors  
For all servo motors of the αi series, a small dedicated connector is used for the Encoder signals. The 
connector is drip-proof when engaged with the motor connector. 

There are two types of connectors depending on how a cable is connected to a connector: the crimp type 
and the solder type. For the crimp type connector, a dedicated crimping tool is required. 

The diameter of the cable used is restricted considering cable clamp and voltage drop. The connectors 
for signals do not have to conform to IEC60034.

33.4 Connectors for the Brake 
The αHViS Series servo motors use a dedicated connector to connect power for the built-in brake. This 
connector is drip-proof. Because it is connected by soldering, no special tool is required. 

This connector differs from conventional connectors used for the α Series. The following subsection 
explains this connector. 

Consider soldering, cable clamp, and voltage drop. Also note that there are restrictions. The connector for 
the 24-V brake does not conform to the IEC60034 standard.

Cable Considerations 
Consider the following conditions for use when selecting the motor power cable. 

1. Motor current rating or actual current needed for motor loaded based on application requirements. 

2. Cable type (heat resistance temperature, etc.) 

3. Environment in which the cable is installed (operating ambient temperature, etc.). 

4. Need for waterproofing. (Note the diameter of the applicable cable clamp.) 

5. Certification for CE marking (compliance with various safety standards and EMC standard) 

6. Securing insulation space among the cable pins at the time of cabling 

Motor Connector 
The specification of the motor power connector varies from one motor model to another. 

Refer to “ 96HMotor Power Connectors on page IV- 97H48 for motor power connector part numbers. 

 

Details of Cable K21 – Motor Power to αSVM1-180HVi Amplifier 

 

 
Notes: 

1. When the αHVi Series amplifier is used, always mount the motor so that it is connected to the system 
ground. If it is not possible to connect the motor flange to the system ground, connect the motor 
flange and frame ground (ground plate of the cabinet) using a cable at least 1.25 mm2 thick. The 
cable must be separated from the power lines as much as possible. 

2. Size of screw for motor power line TB2 (U), TB2 (V), and TB2 (W): M6 

3. Size of screw for motor ground lead TB2 (G): M6 

4. Size of screws for connection between motor flange and ground: M5

Notes: 
1. The ground plate to which the shield is connected must be placed as close as possible to the 

servo amplifier so that distance between the ground plate and the servo amplifier is minimized. 

2. The total resistance of the complete wiring run, comprised of the 5V and 0V lines, must be less 
than 2Ω. Higher resistance will reduce the supply voltage to the serial encoder, possibly resulting 
in unreliable operation of the encoder. 

3. The encoder connector can accept a maximum wire size of 0.5mm2 (wire construction 20/0.18 or 
104/0.08, diameter Φ1.5 or less) wire and sheath diameter is Φ5.7 to Φ8.0. When using thicker 
wire or cable, take the measures described below.

IV-72  Servo Products Specification Guide –  October 2007 GFH-001F 

Details of Cable K69 – PSM Interface to SVM Amplifiers 
The cable K69 is used between the PSM and SVM when supplying power from one IC800ABK001 
multi-axis encoder battery unit to more than one SVM amplifier. This cable interface is also used to 
supply 24VDC power from the PSM power supply module to all connected SVM amplifiers. Additionally, 
all connected SVM amplifiers can share a system emergency stop (ESP) signal. 

Warning 
When using the built-in battery (IC800ABK002 or IC800ABK003), never connect the 
BATL(B3) of the connector CXA2A/CXA2B. Otherwise, a short-circuit will occur 
between the battery output voltages for different SVMs, possibly resulting in the 
batteries becoming very hot, which is dangerous. 

Do not connect more than one IC800ABK001 multi-axis battery kit to the same 
BATL(B3) line. Otherwise, a short-circuit will occur between the output voltages of 
different batteries, possibly resulting in the batteries becoming very hot, which is 
dangerous. 

Up to six servo motors can be connected to one battery. The life of the batteries is about two years if they 
are used for six αi series servo motors.
