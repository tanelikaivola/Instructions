I. CNC FUNCTIONS 



1. OUTLINE 

’ 1. OUTLINE 

The Series O/00/0-Mate are high-performance 

CNCs developed to provide the outstanding 

speed, precision and efficiency demanded to 

accomplish the machining of the future and all 

in a remarkably compact machine configura- 

tion. They achieve a substantial boost in 

machining productivity thanks to their high- 

speed, high-precision digital servo system, 

high-speed PMC functions, and abundant CNC 

functions made possible through the adoption 

of a high-speed microprocessor. 

Seires O/O Mate includes following models : 

O-Mate MC / O-MC 

For machining center, drilling machine and 

milling machine 

O-Mate MF / 0-MF 

Conversational type for machining center, 

drilling machine and milling machine 

O-Mate TC / 0-TC 

For all-purpose lathe, automatic lathe and 

lathe controlled by programmable controller 

0-TF 

Conversational type for all-purpose lathe, 

automatic lathe and lathe controlled by 

programmable controller 

0-T-l-c 

For 4-axis lathe such as single spindle and 

2 tool posts, twin spindles and 2 tool posts 

00-TC, 00-MC .. 

It is a 3-in 1 CNC comprising MMC, CNC 

and PMC. Functions of 0-TC or O-MC are 

adopted for this CNC. 

o-GCCIOO-GCC 

For cylindrical grinding function 

o-GSC/OO-GCC 

For surface grinding function 

CNC functions for the above eight models are 

explained in this chapter. See chapter u for 

CNC 

l-l Bud t-in type PMC 
fl I/O 

Conversational Programming Functions. Also 

see the operator’s manuals of MMC for details 

of MMC functions. A high-speed micro 

processor and many custom LSls have been 

employed for the control circuit, successfully 

decreasing the number of circuit elements to 

the greatest extent. Therefore, its reliability is 

much higher, and a small control unit with a 

power supply unit can be easily built into the 

magnetic power cabinet on the machine. 

Construction of the control unit is of panel 

mount type which allows easy construction of 

an integrated system of machinery with an 

electrical unit. A simple, heavy current circuit 

on the machine also allows construction of 

more compact, united systems of machine and 

electrical units, because a PMC (programmable 

machine cant-rol) can be in corporated into the 

control unit. 

High-speed, high-accuracy machining can be 

done since the digital servo having a high- 

speed processor and custom LSls exclusively 

employed for it is used in the control circuit of 

the servo system. 

As for the drive unit, it can be made smaller 

than conventional types by using transformer. 

As for the control motor, an absolute position 

detector of a genuinely electronic type can be 

fitted on the detector for an AC servo motor. 

No operation of reference point return is 

required when power is supplied, by employing 

an absolute position detector of full electronic 

type* 
Therefore, restarting of operation after cut-off 

the power supply can be easily. done. 

The spindle motor for CNC is an AC spindle 

motor which is small and of high power. 

High-speed, high-accuracy machining can be 

done since the motor is digitally controlled.

The G codes shall be commanded in a single 

block. 

(1) Polar coordinate interpolation mode(Gl12) 

The axes (linear axis and rotary axis) on which 

polar coordinate interpolation is done are set 

beforehand by parameters. 

Change the mode to polar coordinate 

interpolation mode by commanding G112, and 
a plane (hereinaffter referred to as polar 

coordinate interpolation plane) is selected in 

which linear axis is made to the first axis of the 

plane, and virtual axis being a right angle with 

the linear axis is made to the second axis of 

the plane - Polar coordinate interpolation is 

carried out on this plane. 

in the polar coordinate interpolation mode, the 

command of linear interpolation (GOl) and 

circular interpolation (G02, G03) is possible. 

And both absolute command (G9O) and 

incrtementai command (G9l) are possible. 

For the program command it is possible to 

apply cutter compensation. 

For the path after cutter compensation is done, 

polar coordinate interpolation can be made. 

As feedrate, specify the tangential speed 

(relative speed between the workpiece and the 

tool) on the polar coordinate interpolation plane 

(Cartesian coordinate system) with F. 

(2) Polar coordinate interpolation cancel mode

4.5 Cylindrical Interpolation (G107) 

When the form on the expanded side view of a 

cylinder (form on the cylinder coordinate 

system) is commanded by a program 

command, the NC converts the form into a 

linear axis movement and a rotary axis 

movement then performs a contour control. 

This feature is called the cylindrical 

interpolation. The cyclindrical interpolation is 

commanded with G107.

and incremental command can be made. Cutter 

compensation can be added to the program 

command. Cylindrical interpolation is made for 

the path after cutter compensation.

4.6 Helical Cutting (G02, G03) 

7001 path 

Tangential speed along an arc by 

circular interpolation is the rate specified 

in programminng. 

Helical interpolation is enabled by specifying 

another axis which moves synchronously with 

the circular interpolation by circular commands. 

That is, the tool can be moved helically. 

The command method is to simply add a move 

command axis which is not circular 

interpolation axes, to the circular interpolation 

commands. 

An F command specifies a feed rate along a 

circular arc. Therefore, the feed rate of the 

linear axis is as follows: 

F % (Length of Linear line) / Length of circular arc 

Determine the feed rate so the linear axis feed 

rate does not exceed any of the various limit 

values. 

(Note 1) Cutter compensation is applied only 
for a circular arc. 

(Note 2) Tool length compensation cannot 
be used in a block in which a helicalcutting is 

commanded.

By feeding the tool synchronizing with the 

spindle rotation, thread cutting of the specified 

lead is performed. Specify the lead of the long 

axis direction with the F code. 

(Note 1) Feed hold cannot be executed 
during thread cutting. 

(Retract function is invailid in G32 thread 

cutting) 

(Note 2) Thread cutting is restricted as 

follows.

Pr Feed rate limited by motors employed 

where, 

P: Feed rate in threading (mm/min, inch/min) 

F: Lead (mm. inch) 

R: Spindle revolutions 

5.2 Variable-lead Thread Cutting 

(G34) 

Specifying an increment or a decrement value 

for a lead per screw revolution enables’ 

variable-lead thread cutting to be performed. 

K specifies an increment or a decrement per 

screw revolution in the following command. 

G34 P - F- K -; 

F : Lead in longitudinal axis direction at 

the start point 

K : Increment and decrement of lead 

per spindle revolution 

Addresses other than K are the same as in 

straight/taper thread cutting with G32. 

K can take values of: 

Metric input 

+ 0.0001 - +5000.000 mm/rev 

Inch input 

,+ 0.00001 - & 9.999999 inches/rev 

l-30 



5.THREAD CUTTING 

An alarm is informed, for example, when a K 

exceeding this value is directed, the maximum 

value of lead is exceeded as a result of 

increase or decrease by K or the lead has a 

negative value. 

(Note) The “Thread Cutting Cycle Retract” is 
not effective for G34. 

5.3 Continuous Thread Cutting 

This function for continuous thread cutting 

(block overlap) is such that fractional pulses 

outputted to a joint between move blocks are 

overlapped with the next move for pulse 

processing and outputted. Therefore, 

discontinuous machining sections caused by 

the interruption of move during continuously 

block machining are eliminated, thus making it 

possible to continuously direct the block for 

thread cutting instructions. 

Since the system is controlled in such a 

manner that the synchronism with the spindle 

does not deviate in the joint between blocks 

wherever possible, it is possible to perform 

special thread-cutting operation in which the 

lead and shape change midway. 

Even when the same section is repeated for 

thread cutting while changing the depth of cut, 

this system allows a correct machining without 

impairing the threads. 

(Note 1) Block overlap is effective even for 
GO1 command, producing a more excellent 

finishing surface. 

(Note 2) When extreme micro blocks 

continue, no block overlap may function.

Acceleration and deceleration is performed 

when starting and ending movement, resulting 

in smooth start and stop.

6.5 Linear Acceleration I 
Deceleration after Cutting Feed 
Interpolation 

In the linear acceleration/deceleration, the delay’ 

for the command caused by the 

acceleration/deceleration becomes l/2 

compared with that in exponential acceleration/ 

decereration, substantially reducing the time 

required for acceleration and decereration. 

Also, the radius direction error in the circular 

interpolation caused by the acceleration/ 

deceleration is substantially reduced. 

Af / Command path 

Ar : Maximum value of radius error (mm) 

v : Feedrate (mm/see) 

r : Circular radius(mm) 
1, : Acceleration/deceleration time constant (set) 
7, : Time constant of servo motor (set) 

The maximum value of error in this radius 

direction is obtained approximately by the 

following equation. 

Ar = (T12/2 + T$/2)vVr . 

For exponential acceleration/deceleration 

Or = (T,2/24 + T$/2)vVr 

For linear acceleration/deceleration after 

cutting feed interpolation 

Consequently, In case of the linear acceleration 

/deceleration after interpolation, if an error 

caused by the servo loop time constant is 

excluded, the radius directional error will be 

reduced to l/l 2, compared with the exponential 

acceleration/ deceleration.

Move command in blocks commanded with 

GO9 decelerates at the end point, and 

inposition check is performed. GO9 command 

is not necessary for deceieration at the end 

point for positioning and inposition check is 

also done automatically.This function is used 

when sharp edges are required for workpiece 

corners in cutting feed. 

6.8 Exact Stop Mode (G61) 

When G61 is commanded, deceleration of 

cutting feed command at the end point and 

inposition check, is performed per block 

thereafter.This G61 is valid till G64(cutting 

mode), G62 (automatic corner override), or 

G63 (tapping mode) is commanded.

6.10 Tapping Mode (G63) 

When G63 is commanded, feed rate override is 

ignored (always regarded as loo%), and feed 

hold also becomes invalid. Cutting feed does 

not decelerate at the end of block to transfer to 

the next block. And in-tapping mode signal is 

issued during tapping operation-This G63 is 

valid till G61 (exact stop mode), G62 

(automatic corner override), or G64 (cutting

commands refer to a coordinate value in this 

work coordinate system. 

8.2 Coordinate System Shift 

The coordinate system can be shifted by the 

specified amount by programming after it has 

once been set. 

A new coordinate system can be produced by 

specifying a difference between the tool A 

position and the tool B position, using a

Setting work coordinate system 

Six work coordinate systems can be set. 

These six systems are decided by setting the 

distances of each axis from the machine zero 

point to the zero points of the coordinate 

systems, (i.e. the work zero point offset value, 

by using the CRT/MD1 panel). 

8.5 Work coordinate system shift 

When the work coordinate system set with a 

G50 command or the automatic coordinate 

system setting function is different from the 

coordinate system used in programming, 

surface A and B are cut and the coordinate 

system can be shifted by storing the measured 

distance directly as from CRTIMDI.

When the coordinate system actually set by the 

G50 command or the automatic coordinate

There are two ways to command travels along 

the axes; the absolute command, and the

programmed; in the incremental command, 

move distance of the axis itself is programmed. 

9.2 Polar Coordinate Command 
(G15, G16) 

The end point coordinate value can be input in 

polar coordinates (radius and angle). Use G15, 

G16 for polar coordinates command. 

G15: Polar coordinate system command cancel 

G16: Polar coordinate system command 

Plane selection of the polar coordinates is done 

same as plane selection in circular 

interpolation, using G17, G18, G19. 

Command radius in the first axis of the 

selected plane, and angle in the second axis. 

For example, when the X-Y plane is selected, 

command radius with address X, and angle 

with address Y. The plus direction of the angle 

is counterclockwise direction; the minus 

direction is the clockwise direction. 

Both radius and angle can be commanded in 

either absolute or incremental command 

(GW,G91). 

The center of the polar coordinates is the zero 

point of the local coordinates.

This function is useful to prevent seizure of the

10.9 Multi-spindle Control 

1) Outline 

This multi-spindle control is used to control two 

spindles in addition to the normal spindle. 

The spindle is commanded by one S4/5 digit 

command. The signal from PMC determines 

which spindle should be selected. 

The spindle which can be added has two-step 

gear selection for each. One channel can be 

added as the position coder interface and the 

selection depends on the signal from PMC. 

2) Control method 

The rotation command by S command is output 

as analog voltage of each spindle by the 

spindle switching signals (SWSI - SWS3). At 

the same time, output of two spindles or more 

can be made. 

The spindle analog voltage selected by a 

switching signal holds the previous voltage 

even if the switching signal is turned off. Thus, 

each spindle can be simultaneously rotated by 

different S command. Also, each spindle is 

provided with the signals (*SSTPl - *SSTP3) 

for stopping the spindle so that unneeded 

spindles can be stopped. 

3) 

a) 

b) 

C) 

d) 

Cautions 

The constant surface, speed control 

becomes effective for the selected spindle 

only. 

The signal during spindle orientation, 

spindle override signal, spindle stop signal 

(*SSTP), and polarity signals (SSIN and 

SGN) are effective for the selected spindle 

only. 

When only the 1st axis is selected, the 

control signals (SIND and Rl i - R12l) are 

valid. 

The thread cutting, synchronous feed, and 

spindle fluctuation detection functions are 

used to calculate and process the spindle 

speed rate by the pulse from the position 

coder selected by the PMC signal 

(PC2SLCT).

10.10 Serial Spindle 

The speed of the serial interface spindle is 

controlled. 

The spindle speed is specified with a 5digit 

numeric value following address S. A speed 

command is output to the spindle motor 

according to the specified spindle speed. 

During constant surface speed control, a speed 

command is output so that it matches the 

spindle speed reached after constant surface 

speed control. 

10.11 Cs Contour Control 

The serial interface spindle permits positioning 

and linear interpolation with another servo axis. 

Thus, linear interpolation between the spindle 

and a servo axis can be specified. 

(I) Control mode 

The serial interface spindle has two modes. 
. The spindle rotation control mode controls 

the speed of the spindle. (The spindle is 

rotated according to a speed command.) 
. The spindle contour control mode (also 

called Cs contour control) controls the 

position of the spindle. (The spindle is 

rotated according to a move command.) 

These modes are switched by a signal sent 

from the PMC. 

(2) Spindle contour control axis 

The axis subject to spindle contour control is 

placed as one of the CNC control axes. Any of 

the control axes can be selected as the spindle 

contour control axis. 

With the FSO-TTC, two spindles can be 

controlled. If spindle contour control is 

performed for the two spindles, one spindle 

contour control axis must be placed for each 

tool post. Two spindle contour control axes 

cannot be placed for one tool post. 

(3) Move command 

In manual and automatic operation, a move 

command for the spindle contour control axis is 

programmed in the same way as for a servo 

axis. 

Example) 

4)

control and the other servo axes, linear 

interpolation with the spindle contour 

control axis cannot be performed properly. 

As soon as spindle rotation control is 

switched to spindle contour control, an 

appropriate spindle contour control servo 

loop gain for a selected gear is 

automatically set for a necessary servo 

The axis for which the servo loop 

gain is to be changed, and the spindle 

contour control servo loop gain for this axis 

must be set in parameters for each gear 

beforehand. 

(b) Switching from spindle contour control to 

spindle rotation control 

As soon as spindle contour control is 

switched to spindle rotation control, the 

original servo loop gain is set for the servo 

axis automatically. 

10.12 Spindle Synchronization 
Control 

In machine tools having two spindles (such as 

a lathe), the speeds of the two spindles 

sometimes have to match. This requires when 

a workpiece held on the first spindle is 

transferred to the second spindle while the 

spindles are rotating, and when acceleration/ 

deceleration is performed while a workpiece is 

being held by the first and second spindles. 

When a workpiece having a different figure is 

transferred between the spindles, the rotation 

phases (rotation angles) of the spindles must 

also match. 

The serial interface spindle synchronization 

control function is provided to provide 

synchronization control for two spindles.

The offset number is specified with the last one

11.2 Tool Life Management 

Tools are classified into groups, and tool life 

(hours and times of use) is set for, each 

group.When use of the tool exceeds the preset 

hours or times of use, another tool in the same 

group which has not yet exceeded the preset 

life time is selected.If all the tool in a group 

exceeds the preset life time, a signal is output 

to inform the operator that the tools must be 

changed to new tools. 

With setting the cutter radius compensation 

number and the tool length compensation 

number of the tools, compensation 

corresponding to each tool can also be 

done.With use of this function Factory 

Automatic (FA) comes to a reach. 

This function has the following features: 

Tool life can be set in hours or times of 

use. 

New tool select signal output 

This signal is output when a new tool is 

selected in a group.This can also be used 
for automatic measurement in 

compensations of the new tools. 

Tool change signal 

When all the tools of a group has exceeded 

their life time, this signal is output to inform 

the operator of tool changing required. 

Tool skip signal 

By inputting this signal, tools still not 

exceeding their life time, can also be 

changed. 

(5) Tool life management data is display/ 

modif ication 

All tool life management data is displayed 

on the CRT screen, informing the operator 

of the condition of the tools at a single 

view.lf necessary, the data can be modified 

via the MDI panel. 

Number of groups and number of tools per

life count, and clears the parts counter. It 

compensates for the T code which has been 

programmed according to the life count and a

Measurement (G37) 

By Commanding : 

G37Z ; 

The tool starts moving to the measurement 

position, and keeps on moving till the 

measuring position reach signal from the 

measurement device is output. 

Moving of the tool is stopped when the tool 

head reaches the mesurement position. 

Difference between coordinate values when 

tool has reached the measurement position and 

coordinate value commanded by G37 is added 

to the tool length compensation amount

13.1 Program Number 

A program number is given to each program to 

distinguish a program from other programs. 

The program number is given at the head of 

each program, with a Q-digit number after the 

address 0. 

Program number of the program currently 

under execution is always displayed on the 

CRT screen. Program search of programs 

registered in the memory is done with the 

program number. The program number can be 

used in various other ways. 

13.2 Main Program 

A program is divided into the main program and 

the sub program. The CNC normally operates 

according to the main program, but when a 

command calling a sub program is encountered 

in the main program, control is passed to the 

sub program. When a command indicating to 

return to the main program is encountered in 

the sub program, control is returned to the 

main program.

13.4 Sequence Number 

Sequence number can be given in a 4-digit 

number after the address N at the head of the 

program block. 

The sequence number of the program under 

execution is always displayed on the CRT 

screen. The sequence number can also be 

searched in the program by the sequence 

number search function. 

13.5 Tape Codes 

(IS0 840) 
Automatic 

(EIA RS244-A) 
. 

Either the EIA or the IS0 code can be used as 

tape code. The input program code is 

distinguished with the first end of block code 

(EIA: CR, ISO: LF).

A constant cutting pattern can be repeatedly 

operated, while relocating its position bit by bit. 

By using this cycle, a workpiece can be cut 

efficiently after it has been roughly profiled in 

the previous machining process, such as 

forging, casting, etc. 
The motion as illustrated above is executed by 

the above program command. By this cycle, 

chip processing is possible in outer figure 

cutting. If X(U) and P are omitted, the Z axis 

only moves in the deep hole drill cycle.

is compensated by mounting a spring to the 

inside of holder of tapper to improve the 

accuracy of tap cutting. 

The rotation of spindle and feed of 2 axis are 

controlled so that they are always synchronous 

each other in the rigid tapping cycle. Namely, 

in other than rigid tapping, control for speed 

only is performed. In the rigid tapping, 

however, position control is also performed 

during the rotation of spindle, that is, the 

rotation of spindle and feed of 2 axis are 

controlled as tinear interpolation of two axes. 

This allows the following condition to be 

satisfied also during acceleration / deceleration 

at the hole bottom and a tapping of improved 

accuracy to be made. 

P=F/S 

The canned cycle for drilling simplifies the 

program normally by directing the machining 

operation commanded with a few blocks, using 

one block including G-function. 

(Note 1) Spindle is rotated counterclockwise 
by MO4 command. 

(Note 2) Selection of cutting feed or

operation depends on the command of address 

Q . 

14.15 Rigid Tap 

In tapping, the feed amount of 2 axis for one 

rotation of spindle should be equal to the pitch 

of screw of tapper. Namely, the following 

conditions must be satisfied in the best tapping: 

P = F/S, where 

P : Pitch of screw of tapper (mm) 

F : Feed rate of 2 axis (mm/min) 

S : Spindle speed (rpm) 

The rotation of spindle and feed of 2 axis are 

independently controlled in the tapping cycle 

(G84) and left-handed tapping cycle (G74). 

Therefore, the above conditions may not 

always be satisfied. Especially at the hole 

bottom, both the rotation of spindle and feed of 

Z axis reduce the speed and stop. After that, 

they move in the inverse direction while 

increasing the speed. However, the above 

conditions may not be satisfied in general since 

each acceleration 1 deceleration is performed 

independently. Therefore, in general, the feed

Even use of the spindle motor incorporating the

case, the gear ratio of the spindle motor and 

the spindle is set by the parameter. If, 

however, there are multiple gears between the 

spindle motor and the spindle, i.e. , if three 

speed gears (for high, midium, and low speeds) 

are mounted between them, only one of these 

gears enables rigid tapping.

14.18 Angular Axis Control 
(GCC, GSC) 

-----? Specified program 

____) Machine movement 

The angular axis control function is a function 

that the amount of the movement of each axis 

is controlled according to the inclination degree 

if X axis is inclined to 2 axis by an angle other 

than 90”. The program is made supposing that 

X axis and 2 axis are orthogonalized. 

However, the actual movement is controlled 

according to the inclination degree. 

14.19 Normal Direction Control 

WC) 

Corresponding to the dressing figure changes, 

the dresser angle can be controlled to always 

face the normal direction to the figure (program 

command). By commanding Gl5l or Gl52, 

the dresser normal direction control axis 

(rotation axis) is controlled so that the dresser 

always faces the direction perpendicular to the 

advancing direction. 

(In the following description, the dresser normal 

direction control axis is described for the A 

axis .) 

(I) Command method

Normal direction control left side on 

(controlled to face the direction perpen- 

dicular to right side for advancing

For the A axis angle, as shown inthe diagram 

on the right, looking from the A sixs rotation 

center, the + X direction is defined as 0 deg., 

and subsequently for counterclodkwise turns, 

the +Y direction as 180 deg., and the - Y 

direction as 270 deg. 

1 - 82 



14. FUNCTIONS TO SIMPLIFY PROGRAMMING 

(2) Operation 

In the normal direction control, the tool is 

controlled so that it becomes perpendicular to 

the advancing direction of the X-Y plane. 

When moving from cancel mode to normal 

direction control mode, GE51 or GA52 start at 

the start point of the commanded block and the 

A axis becomes perpendicular to the advancing 

direction. 

According to the changes in the advancing 

direction between blocks in the normal 

direction control mode (G151, G152), the A 

axis shift is automatically inserted so that the A 

axis faces the direction perpendicular to the 

advancing direction at the start pint of each 

block. Namely, first the A axis rotates to face 

the direction perpendicular to the shift 

command, and then the X axis and Y axis shifts 

start. 

During the tool diameter compensation mode, 

the A axis is controlled to face the direction 

perpendicular to the advancing direction of the 

path after compensation. In the case of single 

block stopping, it stops at the point after shift 

command block finishes without stopping 

between the A axis rotation block and the shift 

command block. (Position S in the diagram on 

the right)

Nl 
.- ..a.. -. . . . . . . . . . . . . 

S 

4- 

The feed rate of the A axis shift inserted at the 

start point of each block becomes the feed rate 

which was set by parameter. 

However, when dry run is enabled, it becomes 

the dry run rate. Further, in the case that the X 

and Y axis shift commands are rapid traverse 

(GOO), it becomes the rapid traverse rate. 

In the case of circular interpolation, first the A 

axis is rotated so that the A axis faces the 

direction perpendicular to the circular start 

point, and then the circular interpolation starts. 

During circular interpolation execution, .the A 

axis faces the normal direction. 

The rate of the A axis during circular command 

is given by the equation below. 

F’ 
A axis shift amount (deg) 

Length of circular arc (mm or inch) 
(deg/min) 

F: The feed rate commanded by circular block 

(mm/min or inch/min) 

A axis shift amount means the angular 

difference between the start point and end 

point of the block.

14. FUNCTIONS TO SIMPLIFY PROGRAMMING 

A axis is controlled so that it 
always faces the normal direction 
by following the movement of the 
circular interpolation. 

The rotation is 
inserted so that the 
A axis faces the 
normal direction at 
the circular start 
point. \ 

Circular center 

(3) Precautions 

(Note 1) A axis rotation direction during 
normal direction control becomes the direction 

so that it is always less than 180”. (Namely, 

becomes the shorter path.) 

(Note 2) A axis must not be commanded 
during normal direction control. If it is 

commanded, that command will be ignored. 

(Note 3) Before starting the normal direction 
control, it is necessary to make a correct 

correspondence between the A axis coordinate 

value and the A axis position of the actual 

device by the coodinate system setting (G92), 

etc. 

(Note 4) A axis must be the rotation axis. 
(Note 5) Helical cutting cannot be com- 
manded during normal direction control. 

(Note 6) Helical cutting option is necessary 
for using this function. 

14.20 Infeed Control

14. FUNCTIONS TO SIMPLIFY PROGRAMMING 

Moveover, GO4 dwell can be skipped by 

parameter. 

Which is effective in four skip signals can be 

chosen by the parameter. 

One skip signal can be effective to several Pns 

(n = 1,2,3,4) by the setting. 

A skip signal (4 Max.) from the gauging device, 

for example, can skip a program being 

executed. 

For example, a series of operations can be 

automatically performed, including roughing to 

start-out by entering each skip signal upon 

completion of roughing, coarse finishing, fine 

finishing and spark-out by entering each skip 

signal upon completion of roughing, coarse 

finishing, fine finishing and speak-out during

15.11 Continuous Dressing (GSC) 

In the plane grinding canned cycle (G75, G77 

to G79), grindstone cutting and dresser cutting 

is continuously compensated according to the 

dressing amount by continuous dressing during 

the grinding execution. 

(1) Command method 

For the block of the plane grinding canned 

cycle, the offset number (grindstone wear 

compensation number) is specified by address 

I. The compensation amount set in the offset 

memory corresponding to the specified number 

becomes the dressing amount. 

A maximum of 200 numbers (LO1 to l-200) can 

be commanded for the offset number. 

However, this 200 is the total of the numbers 

used for the tool diameter compensation (G41, 

G42) and the tool length compensation (G43, 

G44). The compensation amount correspon- 

ding to the offset number is set in advance by 

the CRT/MD1 panel. 

In the block of the plane grinding canned cycle, 

when L is not commanded, or when LO is 

commanded, the compensation operation is not 

performed. 

(2) Compensation operation 

Performed for each grinding operation of the 

operation sequence during the grinding canned 

cycle (for each shift of X axis), and becomes 

simultaneous 3 axis interpolation simulta- 

neously with the shift of the X axis by 

compensation of the Y axis (grindstone cutting) 

direction and V axis (dresser cutting) direction. 



15. COMPENSATION FUNCTIONS 

The Y axis shift amout (compensation amount) 

becomes a value twice the specified dressing 

amout, and the V axis shift amount becomes a 

value twice the specified dressing amount 

(diameter).

The skip function can be used when the 

movement amount is not clear, as in fixed 

amount feed by grinder. 

16.2 High-speed Skip Signal Input 

Delay and error of skip signal input is 0 - 2 

msec at the NC side (not Considering those at 

the PMC side). 

This high speed skip signal input function 

keeps this value to 0.1 msec or less, thus 

allowing high precision measurement. This 

signal is connected directly to the NC; not via 

the PMC. 

16. MEASUREMENT FUNCTIONS 

16.3 Tool Length Measurement 

Difference set as 

Call offset value display screen on the CRT. 

Relative positions are also displayed on this 

screen. Reset the displayed relative position to 

zero. Set the tool for measurement at the 

same fixed point on the machine by hand. 

The relative position display at this point shows 

difference between the reference tool and the 

tool measured. The relative position display 

value is then set instead of numerals as offset 

amounts, with the same operation as offset 

amount setting. 

16.4 Automatic Tool Offset 

A Tool offset value 

Cr edict ed Measuring measuring 
position position 

G36Xxa ; or G37Zzc~ ; + Revision of offset amount - 

When a tool is moved to the measurement 

position by execution of a command given to 

CNC, the CNC automatically measures the 

difference between the current coordinate 

value and the coordinate value of the commnad 

measurement position and uses it as the offset 

amount for the tool. When the tool is moved to 

the measurement position in offset mode and 

an amount to be further offset is generated as 

the result of the measurement, the current 

off set amount is further offset. When the tool 

geometry offset & tool wear offset option is 

selected, the tool wear amount (wear offset 

amount) is compensated. 

1-91 



16. MEASUREMENT FUNCTIONS 

(1) Coordinate system 

When moving the tool to a position for 

measurement, the coordinate system must be 

set in advance. GSOXxZz ; sets the coordinate 

system. (Automatic coordinate system setting 

may be designated.) (The work coordinate 

system for programming is used in common.) 

(2) Movement to measurement position 

A movement to a measurement position is 

performed by specifying G36Xxa or G37Zza in 

the MDI or AUTO mode. In this case, the 

measurement position should be xa or za 

(absolute command). 

Execution of this command moves the tool at 

the rapid traverse rate toward the measurement 

position, lowers the feed rate halfway, then 

continues to move it until1 the approach end 

signal from the measuring instrument is issued. 

When the tool tip reaches the measurement 

position, the measuring instrument sends a 

signal to the CNC which stops the tool. 

(3) Offset 

The current tool offset amount is further offset 

by the difference between the coordinate value 

(a, p) when the tool has reached the 

measurement position and the value of xa or za 

specified in G36 Xxa or G37Zza. 

Offset amount x 

= current offset amount x + (CT - xa) 

Offset amount z 

= current offset amount z + (j3-za) 

These offset amounts can also be altered from 

the MDI keyboard. 

(4) Feed rate and alarm 

The tool, when moving from the starting 

position toward the measurement position 

predicted by xa or za in G36 or G37, is fed at 

the rapid traverse rate across area 0. Then 

the tool stops at point T (xa - yx or za - yz) and 

moves at the measurement feed rate set by 

parameter across areas @, 0 and 0. If the 

approach end signal turns on during movement 

across area @I, alarm No. 80 is generated. If

The following convenient method can be used 

to set the offset value as the difference

standard tool or the turret center, and the tip of 

the tool actually used. 

A work coordinate system is assumed to have 

been set in advance.

Measure distance “p” between surface A 

and the zero point in the work coordinate 

system , and set it to the offset number 

desired as the Z offset value (MZ). 
Cut the workpiece along surface B in 

manual mode. 

Release the tool along Z axis direction 

without X axis movement and stop spindle 

rotation. 

Measure distance “a” and set it to the 

offset number desired as the X offset value 

(MX)= 

Repeat the above operation for each tool used. 

If the coordinate value of the tool as surface B 

is 105.0, the measured distance a is 104.0 and 

104.0 is set to offset number 3 of address X as 

MX, the offset value 1 .O is automatically set to 

offset number 3 of address X. 

(Note 1) This function is effective only when 
the parameter DOFSI. is set to 1. 

(Note 2) The X axis must always be 
measured in diameter. 

(Note 3) When the measured value is input 

as the geometry offset amount, and the 

corresponding wear offset amount becomes 

zero. 

(Note 4) When the measured value is input 

as the wear offset amount becomes zero. 

Geometry offset amount does not change, 

while the difference between the whole offset 

amount and the geometry offset amount is set 

as the wear offset amount. 

(Note 5) This function can be performed by 
retracting both axes, when PMC and RECORD 

button are provided.

\ 

G65Hm 

P Q R ; --- 
A gorup of 

instructions for a 

certain function 

The custom macro function previously loads 

macro instructions created by user into 

memory as subprograms, and uses them from 

CNC command programs by a simple 

procedure at all times. 

This custom macro function can employ macro 

instructions, such as CNC commands using 

variables, arithmetic operation, conditional 

branch, etc. as well as ordinary CNC 

commands. 

The following functions are applicable when 

programming the custom macro body. 

Variables 

Representation of variables 

Variables are represented by variable 

numbers following # as follows. 

#i (i = 1, 2, 3, . . . . ...) 

Quotation of variables 

Numeric values following an address can 

be replaced with variables. 

(Examples) 

F#lO3 I..... Specifies the feedrate of #103 

value. 

GOOZ-#lOO . . Specifies the positioning to 

the 4100 position. 

G#130 I..... Specifies G code by the #I30 

value. 

(3) 

If variable number i is replaced with 

variable #j, don’t describe ##j, but describe 

#9j. 

(where #j = i) 

(Example) 

#9100 = -500 when #lOO = 105 and #IO5 

= -500 

Kinds of variables 

Common variables 

The common variables are variables 

common to main programs and respective 

macros to be called by these main 

programs. Accordingly, a common variable 

value arithmetically operated in a certain 

macro can also be used in the other 

macros. 

System variables 

The system variables mean the variables 

whose applications are predetermined by 

the system. The offset amount, interface 

input signals, position information, and 

other data can be known from the 

predetermined variables. The offset 

amount can also be set by substituting the 

off set amount. 

Macro instruction 

The macro instruction is generally 

represented in the following format. 

G65HmP#iQ#JR 

#i: Name of variable to which arithmetic 

result is entered. 

#j: Name of variable to be calculated (A 

constant is also allowable.) 

#k: Name of variable to be calculated (A 

constant is also allowable.) 

Hm: Operator (For details, refer to the 

following table.) 

(Note 1) Be careful since no decimal point is 
applicable to a variable value. 

(Note 2) The unit of angle is 0.001 O.

(2) Operation between variables 

Various operation can be done between 

variables and between variables and 

constants. 

The following operations, and functions can 

be used: 

+ (sum), -(difference), *(product),/ 

(quotation), OR (logical sum), XOR 

(exclusive logical sum), AND (logical

(3) Control command 

Program flow in the custom macro body is 

controlled by the following command. 

(a) If [ < Conditional expression > ] GOT0 n 

(n = sequence number) 

When < conditional expression > is 

satisfied, the next execution is done from 

block with sequence number n. 

When [ <conditional expression > ] is not 

satisfied, the next block is executed. 

When the [ < IF conditional expression ) ] 

is committed, it executes from block with n 

unconditionally. 

The following < conditional expressions > 

are available: 

#j EQ #k whether #j =#k 

#jNE#k whether #j *#k 

#j GT#k whether #j >#k 

#j LT#k whether #j <#k 

#j GE#k whether #j Z#k

(b) WHILE [ <conditional expression >] DO m 

(m= 1, 2. 3) 

END m 

While <conditional expression ) is 

satisfied, blocks from DO m to END m is 
repeated. 

When <conditional expression > is no 

more satisfied, it is executed from the 

block next to 

END m block.

Macro call by G codes 

The macro can also be called by the G 

codes set by parameters. Instead of 

commanding: 

N G65 P - < argument assignment >; 

or 

N G66 P < argument assignment >; , 

m&o canTe called just by commanding: 

N G < argument assignment) ; . 

Gcode G for calling the macro, and 

macro program number P to be called, 

are coupled togehter and set as parameter. 

Maximum ten G codes from GO1 to G255 

can be used for macro call (GO0 cannot be 

used). 

The G code macro call cannot be used in 

the macro which was called by a G code. 

It also cannot be used in sub programs 

called by sub program call with M codes or 

T codes. 

Sub program call by M code 

An M code can be set by parameter to call 

a sub program. Instead of commanding: 

N G X Y . . ..M98 P ; , 

the same operation c& be performed 

simply by commanding: 

N G X Y . . ..M ;. -- 
Asfor%l98, M codes are not transmitted. 

The M code M for calling the sub 

program and the sub program number 

P to be called are coupled together and 

sgby parameter. 

Maximum three M codes from MO3 to M97 

can be used for macro call (M30 cannot be 

used). 

Arguments cannot be transmitted. It also 

cannot be commanded in the same block 

as the block with M98 command. 

When these M codes are commanded in 

macro called by G code or in sub program 

called by M code or T code, they are 

regarded as ordinary M codes. 

Sub program call by T code 

By setting parameter, sub program can be 

called by T codes. When commanded: 

N G X Y . . ..Tt. , w--p

17. CUSTOM MACRO 

the same operation is done as when 

commanded: 

#I49 = t; 

NGXY . . ..M98 P90000; . 

The Tcoder is stored as arguments of 

common variable #I 49. 

This command cannot be done in the same 

block with a sub program calling M code, 

or with M98 command. 

When T code is commanded in macros 

called by G code, or in sub programs 

called by M codes or T codes, the T code 

is treated as ordinary T codes. 

Types of variables 

Variables are divided into local variables, 

common variables, and system variables, 

according to their variable numbers. Each 

type has different use and nature. 

Local variables #l - #33 

Local variables are variables used locally in 

the macro. Accordingly, in case of 

multiples calls (calling macro B from macro 

A), the local variable used in macro A is 

never cleared by being used in macro B. 

Common variables #1 00-#149, #500 - #531 

Compared with local variables used locally 

in a macro, common variables are common 

throughout the main program, each sub 

program called from the main program, and 

each macro. The #l used in a certain 

macro is the same as the #i used in other 

macros. Therefore, a common variable #i 

calculated in a macro can be used in any 

other macros. 

Common variables WOO to #149 are 

cleared when power is’ turned off, but 

common variables #500 to #531 are not 

cleared after power is turned off. 

(Note) It is possible to increase number 
of common variables. For details, see 

” Number of common variables”.

setting these numerical values from CRT/MD1 

unit without any need of programming using an 

existing CNC language. 

With the aid of this function, a machine tool

(boring cycle, tapping cycle, or the like), for 

example, by utilizing the custom macro 

function, and load the boring cycle into the 

program memory. 

(1) This cycle is designated as pattern names 

like BORl, TAP3, DRL2, . . . . 

An operator can select a desired pattern 

out of the menu of pattern names being 

displayed on CRT. 

(2) A cycle should be prepared by using 

variables (pattern data) which are specified 

by the operator. 

The operator can identify these variables 

as depth, return relief, feed, blank, and

procedure as in the custom macro program 

and store it in ROM cassette. Consequently, 

unlike the custom macro, the macro program 

does not occupy the tape storage area. Since 

the macro program is converted to an

18.1 Mechanical Handle Feed 

Brake n 

No Excitation 

(Servo off) 

It is possible to move the machine by hand, 

using the mechanical handle installed on the 

machine; not by the CNC (servo motor). 

Move distance by the mechanical handle is 

followed up and actual position in the CNC is 

revised. The mechanical handle feed is done 

by inputting the servo off signal of the axis fed. 

Machine side signal desides on/off of follow up 

function when servo off. However, the follow 

up can not be applied when emergency stop is 

on or when servo alarm is on. Inch/metric 

conversion cannot be used when mechanical 

handle feed function is used.

23.10 Simple Synchronous Control 

The travelling command of master axis is given 

to two motors of master and slave axes in a 

simple synchronous control.However,no 

synchronous error compensation or 

synchronous error alarm is detected for 

constantly detecting the position deviation of 

the master and slave axes to compensate the 

deviation. 

In the reference point return,the master and 

slave axes similarly move until the deceleration 

operation is performed. After that, the 

detection of grid is performed independently. 

The pitch error and backlash compensation are 

independently performed for the master and 

slave axes. 

An input signal from the machine side can 

select whether the axis travelling is carried out 

based on the traveiling command for that axis 

as in normal case or whether the axis traveiling 

is carried out while synchronizing with the 

traveiiing of any other axis. 

Simple synchronous operation is allowed in the 

automatic operation by tape command,manual 

data input,or memory command and in the 

manual operation such as manual continuous 

feed,manual handle feed,incremental feed,or 

manual reference point return.

23. PART PROGRAM STORAGE & EDITING 

23.12 Input/Output Simultaneous 
Operation 

If a cycle operation is put into effect with DNC 

signal being ON, an external program is 

executed for operation and simultaneously the 

external program is stored in the memory of 

the control. 

Also, a program in the memory of the control is 

executed and simultaneously output to an 

external device. 

1) Input and machining simultaneous 

operation 

a) Search a head of a program to be 

executed.

(DNCI). 

Turn on the input and machining

Press the cycle start button. 

e) A program is executed for operation 

and input in the memory block by

23.13 Operation When Converting 
the Machining Program 
Prepared by Graphic 
Conversation to an NC 
Format Program and 
Outputting Externally Via the 
Reader/puncher Interface 

The machining program prepared by graphic 

conversation is stored in the tape memory 

areas as a special data type. Therefore, of 

course, the data cannot be displayed merely as 

it is in NC format and one part of the data 

cannot be changed. 

However, after that machining program 

prepared by graphic conversation has been 

converted to an NC format program, it is 

possible to output it outside the NC via the NC 

reader/puncher interface. 

After conversion, the NC format program 

outputted outside the NC will be of the form 

displayed by the NC program form by the NC 

operation command automatically prepared 

when executing that machining program. 

Accordingly, it is normal that I NC operation 

command is converted as 1 block program. 

For example. one group of bar machining is not 

indicated by canned cycle G71. 

In other words, in order to convert the canned 

cycle to a form can be resolved into each 

operation unit, after actual conversion, the 

outputted NC format program becomes longer 

in proportion to the machining operation. 

When the machining program is converted to 

NC format and output to outside the NC, be 

sure to set the memory protect switch on the 

machine operator’s panel to the lock state.

25. POLIGONAL TURNING 

25. POLIGONAL TURNING 

Polygonal turning means machining a polygonal 

figure by rotating the workpiece and tool at a 

certain ratio. 

(1) Rotation ratio of workpiece and tool 

(2) Number of cutter 

By changing these conditions,the machining 

figure can be changed to a square or 

hexagon-The machining time can be reduced 

as compared with polygonal figure machining 

using C and X axes of the polar coodinate.The 

machined figure however,is not exactly 

polygonal .Generally,polygonal turning is used 

for the heads square and/or hexagon bolts or 

hexagon nuts. 

n------/ 

Tool rotation for polygonal turning is controlled 

by CNC controlled axis. 

The rotary axis of tool is called Y axis in the 

following description. 

The Y axis is controlled by G25.1 command,so 

that the rotation speeds of the workpiece 

mounted on the spindle (previously specified by 

S-command)and the tool become the specified 

ratio. 

G251 P Q ; -w 
P ,Q : Rotation ratio of spindle and Y axis 

Specify range :Integer 1 to 9 for both P 

and Q . 

When Q is a positive value, Y axis 

makes positive rotation. 

When Q is a negative value,\/ axis makes 

negative ratation. 

(Example)Rotation ratio of workpiece( spindle) 

to Y axis is 1:2,and the Y axis makes positive 

rotation. 

G51.2P1 Q2; 

When simultaneous start is specified by 

G251,the one-rotation signal sent from the 

position coder set on the spindle is 

detected,and the Y axis rotation is controlled 

according to the rotation ratio(P:Q)while 

synchronizing with the spindle 

speed.Namely,the Y axis rotation is controlled 

so that the spindle and Y axis stand in a 

relation of P:Q.This relation will be maintained 

until the polygonal turning cancel command is 

executed(G50.2 or reset operation).The 

direction of Y axis rotation is determined by the 

sign of Q and not affected by that of the 

position coder rotation. 

Synchronization of the spindle and Y axis is 

cancelled by the following command: 

G250; 

When G250 is specified,synchronization of the 

spindle and Y axis is cancelled and the Y axis 

stop.This synchronization is also cancelled in 

the

28.1 Emergency Stop 

Emzop buttom 

With the emergency stop, all commands stops, 

and the machine stops immediately.Connect 

the “emergency stop” signal both to the control 

unit and to the servo unit side. 

When emergency stop is commanded, servo 

excitation is also reset, and servo ready signal 

will also turn off-After resetting the emergency 

stop, continue the operation after performing 

the reference point return operation. 

28.2 Over-travel Functions 

28.2.1 Overtravel 

- ,-b- iT_ 
Limit switch 

’ X axis movable range 

As this CNC’s basic specifications cover the 

software limit detection function, it is generally 

unnecessary to provide the limit switch and dog 

function on the machine tool side for the 

purpose of overtravel detection. 

In order to solve such a case as the stroke end 

position in the + 2 direction changes each time 

the tailstock travels in keeping with th’e 

movement of a workpiece, an interface is 

provided to be able to receive a signal from the 

limit switch as an overtravel signal in the + 2 

direction only. In other words,the limit switch is 

mounted to the tailstock and its contact is 

connected to * + LZ terminal, so that the stroke 

and position can be detected correctly in 

keeping with the travel of the tailstock. 

28.2.2 Stored stroke limit 

B(X2 ’ Cl Forbidden area of tool 

Points A and B are set by parameters 

The area outside an area preset by a 

parameter is defined as a forbidden area.If the 

machine tool enters the forbidden area, the 

axis motion is decelerated and stopped with 

overtravel alarm display.(stored stroke limit) 

The distance from the reference return position 

is set to the parameter. Stored stroke limit 

function can be made to be ineffective by 

parameter setting. 

28.2.3 External setting function of 
stored stroke limit 

When changing a tool, this function rewrites the 

machine position (machine coordinate) of that 

time into parameter values (No. 700-702, 704. 

706) as the stored stroke limit by adapting its 

tip position to the end of the limit area and 

depressing the SETTING key. 

Setting signals are provided for each axis and 

direction ( + X, + Y, + Z, -X, -Y, -Z). 

In addition, by turning the common LIMIT 

RELEASE button for all axes to the ON 

position, it is also possible to arrange that the 

stroke limit may not be checked. 



28. SAFETY FUNCTIONS 

28.2.4 Expanded Stored Stroke 
check 

1 St limit 

The area in which a tool may not travel 

(forbidden area) can be divided into the 

following two blocks for setting.The shaded 

portions above show the area in which no tool 

can move. 

1st limit: 

2sl 

Set the boundary,using parametersThe 

outer side of boundary thus preset 

corresponds to the forbidden area.This is 

normally not changed once the machine 

tool builder sets this area.Therefore,always 

set the boundary to the maximum stroke of 

a machine. 

limit: 

Set the boundary,using parameters or 

program command.The inner or outer side 

of boundary preset corresponds to the tool 

entry prohibited area.The inner or outer 

side is determined by parameter. G22 

prohibits the tool from entering the 

forbidden area of the 2nd limit. 

28.3 Interlock 

Motor speed 

A 

axes is inhibited or the movement of Z axis 

only is inhibited can be set by parameters. 

When all axes movement is inhibited, high 

speed interlock input can be used. Interlock 

also can be applied to each axis independently 

by parameter,. 

When this interlock signal is applied, the 

moving part of the machine tool stops after 

being decelerated. When this interlock signal is 

released, the machine tool starts moving again 

after being accelerated. 

This interlock function is effective for both 

automatic and manual operation modes. 

28.4 External Deceleration 

Feed rate can be decelerated by an external 

deceleration signal from the machine side. A 

feed rate after deceleration can be set by 

parameter. External deceleration is prepared 

every axis and every direction. 

When the tool is to be moved in the reverse 

direction, futile time may not be wasted since 

no external deceleration is applied. 

Conditions to make this signal effective are set 

by parameters: 

(1) Whether this signal is applied to rapid 

traverse only or to all feeds. 

(2) Whether external deceleration in the + 

direction is made effective (each axis). 

(3) Whether external deceleration in the - 

direction is made effective (each axis). 

This function allows the maximum of valid 

strokes and keeps shock to the machine to a 

minimum, to stop at stroke end. This function 

is also useful when overtravel of the machine 

from the stroke end in, for example, ATC 

reference points , must be kept to a minimum. 

This function inhibits the axis movement of the 

machine tool. Whether the movement of all

interruption has become lower than the 

specified value. Since the above condition is 

usually indicated as the battery alarm display 

on the CRT/MD1 panel, this signal is not 

required normally. .lf the detachable CRT/MD1 is 

employed, inform an operator of the necessity 

of battery exchange by the lamp indication 

using this signal.

value 

offset amount from the machine tool or other 

external devices. Input data are added to the 

offset amount having the offset number 

specified by the program when the tool offset 

amount is externally input. The offset amount 

may also be processed as input data by 

specifying an input signal. 

When the machine tool provides an automatic 

measuring function for tools and workpieces, 

the offset amount can be changed to a correct 

value by inputting an error from the correct 

value into CNC by using this function. 

If the tool offset amount is externally input 

when the offset number 0 is selected by a 

program, (that is, offset cancel), the work 

coordinate system shifts by the input data 

amount. 

The external tool offset amount is 0 - 

2 7.999mm or k 0.7999 inch at a time. 

30.2 External Message Function 

For the message function applied by external 

data input signals, two functions are available. 

However, either the PMC-L or M is requried to 

use this function. 

(1) External alarm message 

“External alarm message” means a 

function which puts the CNC in the alarmed 

condition by sending alarm numbers 

externally and in addition, sends messages 

to the CNC externally and allows them to 

be displayed on the CNC’s CRT screen. 

Four alarm numbers and four messages 

can be sent at the same time. The length 

(2) 

of a message which can be sent against an 

alarm No. is within 15 characters. The 
alarm No. which can be sent will come 

from numbers between 0 and 999. 

However, when the CNC displays, it will 

add 1000. It is also executed using 

external data, to release the alarmed 

condition. 

External operator message 

“External operator message” means a 

function which sends a message and a 

number for the operator to the CNC 

externally and allows to display the 

message on the CNC’s CRT screen. 

Only one message can be sent at one time 

with the message length within 127 

characters. The number which can be sent 

is a number between 0 and 999, however, 

a message of up to No. 99 will be 

displayed with its number to which 2000 is 

added. As to the message of Number from 

100 to 999,. only characters will be 

displayed without its number. 

30.3 External Key-Input Function 

“External Key-Input” means a function which 

can control the CNC by informing CNC of key 

input data from the PMC as if an operator 

entered it into the CRT/MD1 unit. For instance, 

it becomes possible to edit programs (the 

searching for a program No.) by PMC. 

30.4 External Data input 

The following data can be entered,using 

external data input. 

(1) External tool off set 

(2) External message function 

(3) External key input 

(4) External program No. serach 

This function inputs any one of the program 

number 1 to 9999 to CNC from the 

outside,such as the machine side and 

searchs the program from the memory 

For a machine provided with a function of 

loading several types of workpieces

(5) 

automatically, this function can be used to 

search a program automatically according 

to workpiece for execution. 

External work coodinate system shift ( Only 

M series) 

The external work coodinate system shift is 

a function of shifting the work coodinate 

system according to the external shift 

amount. 

This shift amount for each axis is all added 

to the work coodinate system for use. This 

shift amount is not lost even when power is 

turned off. 

This shift amount is not integrated 

incrementally but the input shift amount 

corresponds to a new shift amount. The 

shift amount which can be input is 0 to 

2 0.7999 inch. 

30.5 External Machine Origin Shift 

The machine coordinate system is 

compensated by offset amount given from 

outside. This offset amount always take 

absolute value; never an increment value. 

The offset amount range is: 

0 2 9999 

in detection unit. 

When offset amount is 

machine move distance 

input, the actual 

is the difference 

between the previous offset amount and 

current off set amount. 

This function is used t compensate the 

machine coordinate system error caused by 

mechanical deformation.

The system can be applied to turning tasks in 

which a single workpiece attached to a single 

38. FUNCTION FOR 4-AXIS LATHES (0-TTF) 

spindle is machined using two tool posts 

simultaneously. For example,while one tool 

post performs machining of the outer dimeter, it 

is possible to machine the inner diameter with 

the other tool post. The result is a sharp 

savings in machining time. 

(2) Application to lathes with twin spindles and 

two tool posts 

The system can also be applied to turning 

tasks where two workpieces attached to twin 

separate spindles are simultaneously machined 

using the two tool posts. Because machining 

can thereby be performed with one lathe with 

equal efficiency to two conventional lathes, a 

dramatic increase in productivity can be 

achieved. 

(3) Simultaneousiy,independent control of two 

tool posts 

Using the tool post selection key on the NC 

operator’s panel, the operator selects the 

programs for each of the two tool posts from 

among the programs registered in the memory. 

When the start signal is issued,the system 

simultaneously and independently executes the 

selected two programs, controlling the Xl,Zl 

axes and X2,22 axes respectively. 

Only one operator’s panel is provided for the 

two tool posts. Panel operation and display 

functions for each tool post are determined by 

the tool post selection key provided. 

(4) Tool post waiting function 

The movement of each of the two tool posts 

can be programmed independently, as in the 

case of an ordinary two-axis lathe. M codes 

control the first and second tool posts to wait 

for each other during machining. Or only one 

tool post to machine.

38. FUNCTION FOR 4-AXIS LATHES (0-TTF) 

38.2 Balance Cut(G68,G69) 

. 

G68 : Balance cut mode 

G69 : Balance cut cancel 

When machining the workpieces shown in the 

figure above in a four-axis lathe, machining the 

workpiece with cutters applied to its sides 

simultaneously prevents sagging of the 

workpiece, which would be caused by 

machining from one side only. This results in 

more accurate machinng. if ,however,the 

cutters do not move sysnchronousiy, the 

workpiece will chatter, resulting in no correct 

machining. The use of this function permits 

easy synchronization. 

. 

38.3 Interference Check Function 

breakage of the machne tool itself, may 

happen. 

A 4-axis. lathe is normally provided with two tool 

posts. When a blank is concurrently machined 

by using these two tool posts,it is possible that 

a part of each tool post approaches each other 

very closely. if two tool posts should make 

contact with each other due to a machining 

program failure or other setting failures, a 

serious accident like the damage of tools or the

40.1 REMOTE BUFFER 

The remote buffer is option and is used to 

allow a large number of data to be continuously 

supplied to the CNC at high speed by 

connecting it to the host computer or I/O 

device through a serial interface. 

The following can be performed by the remote 

buffer. 

1 )lt is used to perform DNC operation at high 

speed and with high reliability by performing 

on-line connection to the host computer. 

2)lt is used to download the NC program and 

parameters from the host computer. 

3)lt is used to perform DNC operation and 

download various kinds of data by connecting 

to the l/O device.The following I/O devices can 

be connected.

40.2 High-speed Remote biffer A 
High-speed remote buffer A for FANUC 0 

series is started by a block command 

“GO5; “,thus allowing high-speed 

processing,using the subsequent travel data for 

the specified axes. 

(1) Data format 

The tool moving distance for 4/8 msec shall be 

expressed in binary data. 

Travel sequence ~~~II~-~~~~~~~ _, 

(a) Designate the number of command axes 

N,using parameter No.597. 

(b) One block shall be (27\L + 1)bytes. 

(c) Command the moving distance of each axis 

in 2 bytes-However, be sure to set LSB of each 

byte to 0 . Using the remaining 14 

bits,command the moving distance at intervals 

of 8 msec in the following unit. Command the 

moving distance in the negative direction , 

using the complement of two. 

(Example) When the moving distance in 

8msec is 700 $8 msec: 

IS 8 7 0 

0000101 *0111100* 

“*” should be always 0. 

(d) The check byte is the sum of (2*N) bytes 

data of 8 bits,but the overflown value 

exceeding the 8 bit value is discarded. 

(2) High-speed remote buffer A mode 

For high-speed remote buffer A, its mode 

should be designated. 

High-speed remote 

“G05; u

is 0 for all the N axes. 

(Note) After commanding “GO5; u block with 
a nomal NC command format,command the 

moving distance in the aforementioned format. 

Then, command 0 for the moving distances of 

all axes. Therefore,the high-speed remote 

buffer is placed in the OFF 

mode;hereafter,command the moving distance 

again in a normal NC command format.

3.4 Multi-piece Machining 

Programs 

Arbitrary profiles can be specified easily using 

Symbolic input and the automatic intersection 

computation function. The specified profile 

appears graphically on the screen immediatery, 

thus enabling fast and easy checking and 

revisions. It is also possible to perform contour 

side cutting, contour grooving and contour 

pocketing of specified profiles.

To machine idential products in multiple 

quantities at the same time, the operator need 

prepare the program only for one piece. The 

remaining pieces can be programmed 

automatically, inclusive of the optimum tool 

order. 

(1) Contour side cutting 

Sides of arbitrary profiles which are formed 

from lines and circles can be programmed 

through conversational input.

(2) Contour grooving 

Grooves of arbitrary profiles where the center 

line is formed from lines and circles, as shown 

in the illustration, can be programmed through 

conversational input. 

(3) Contour pocketing 

Pocketing of arbitrary profiles having islands 

such as shown in the illustration can be carried 

out automatically simply by preparing, through 

conversational input, the exterior walls of 

pockets and islands formed from lines and 

circles. Up to 6 islands can be designated, 

each with a different height if necessary. 

3.6Automatic Selection of Cutting 
Conditions and Pre-tools 

The ideal cutting conditions for each machining 

can be automatically set during program 

preparation. Automatic selection for pre- 

machining, as required for drilling, is also 

possible. 

(1) Tool file 

Up to 45 tools in 9 types - drills, taps, end 

mills, etc. - can be registered.

(3) Coefficient data file 

To accommodate cutting conditions which vary 

according to tool diameter, it is possible to 

apply a coefficient for each set of cutting 

conditions. Used together with the tool fiie

3.7 Dynamic Graphic Display 
(For machining center) 

Prepared machining programs can be 

graphically displayed on the screen for visual 

checking prior to actual machining. Two 

display methods are offered. 

(1) Tool path description 

The tool path is described on the screen as a 

line. This feature enables a close check of the 

prepared program. 

0 Because description proceeds at high 

speed, the program check can be completed 

quickly.

@J An automatic scaling feature is provided 

which permits the operator to maintain a 

suitable magnification and keep the focus 

of attention in the middle of the screen at 

all times. 

8 During screen monitoring,, the center of 

partial enlargements and the rate of 

magnification can be commanded when 

needed. This feature enables simple 

enlargement of sections demanding closer 

attention.

(2) Machining profile description 

The changing profile of the workpiece is 

simulated according to the movements of the 

tool as programmed. Because the profile is 

shown in 3 dimensions, the operator can check 

the machining program in detail with great 

ease.

(Note 1) *When read in the significant data zone,the codes are ignored. 

(Note 2) ?:The codes are invalid in the significant data zone, but are registered in the memory. 
(Note 3) Codes not in this table are ignored if their parity is correct 
(Note 4) Codes with incorrect parity cause the TH alarm. But they are ignored without 

generating the TH alarm when they are in the comment zone. 

(Note 5) A character with all eight holes punched does not generate TH alarm even in EiA code.
